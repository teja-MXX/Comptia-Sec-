# THE FEYNMAN STORY: “THE TOWN OF DATAVILLE — REPAINTED CORRECTLY”

Imagine again our small town, DataVille, where everyone guards precious things — money, diaries, photos, secrets.  
Attackers lurk everywhere.  
So the town uses different kinds of “controls” to stay safe.

But here’s the trick:  
No single control can protect the entire town.  
Security is like having multiple layers of defense — seatbelt, airbag, traffic rules, and a traffic cop all at once.

So DataVille uses 6 types of security controls, each like a different character in the town.

# ⭐ 1️⃣ Preventive Controls — “The Lock on the Door”

Their job is simple: Stop the bad thing before it starts.

Like:
- MFA
- Encryption
- Firewalls    
- Access control
    
Analogy:  
A strong lock on your house door so the thief can’t even enter.

# ⭐ 2️⃣ Detective Controls — “The CCTV Camera That Notices”

Their job: Catch the bad thing happening right now.

Like:
- IDS
- Logs
- Monitoring systems
- Alarms
    
Analogy:  
A CCTV camera that spots someone sneaking near your window.

# ⭐ 3️⃣ Corrective Controls — “The Handyman Who Fixes the Damage”

Their job: Fix things after a problem occurs.

Like:
- Patching
- Restoring backup files    
- Reconfiguring a broken system
    
Analogy:  
A handyman fixing a broken window after the thief breaks it.

# ⭐ 4️⃣ Deterrent Controls — “The ‘Beware of Dog’ Board”

Their job: Scare attackers so they think twice.

Like:
- Guards standing visibly
- Big warning signs
- Bright lighting    
- Security policies displayed
    
Analogy:  
A giant “Beware of Dog” board that makes the thief wonder:  
“Do I really want to try this?”

# ⭐ 5️⃣ Compensating Controls — “The Temporary Security Guard”

Their job:  
Cover for a missing or broken control.

Like:
- A guard checking IDs manually when the access card system is down
- Temporary one-time passwords if MFA fails
    
Analogy:  
If your door lock breaks, you hire a guard until a new lock is installed.

# ⭐ 6️⃣ Directive Controls — “The Town Rulebook”

This is the correct sixth control.
Their job: Guide people on what they SHOULD do before anything happens.

These controls don’t stop attacks directly.  
They provide instructions, expectations, and direction.

Like:

- Security policies
- Training materials
- Standard operating procedures
- Posted instructions
- Acceptable use policies
    
Analogy:  
It’s the rulebook given to every citizen in DataVille
- “Lock your doors at night”
- “Do not share your keys”    
- “Report suspicious activity to the guard”
    
This isn’t a lock, a guard, or a CCTV.  
It’s THE instructions that tell people how to behave safely.

It shapes the town’s security culture.
