# 🟦 What is Accounting?

👉 Accounting is the process of recording WHAT a user does after they log in.  
It keeps a logbook of every action.

Authentication = Who are you  
Authorization = What can you access  
Accounting = What did you do?

### Feynman Analogy

Imagine a notebook at a library entry gate where every visitor signs:

- time they entered
- which room they visited
- which book they took
- when they left
    
That notebook = Accounting (Audit Logs).

# 🟩 How Accounting Provides:

## 1. Transparency

Everything is recorded → nothing is hidden.
Like CCTV footage of user actions.

## 2. Security

Logs help detect:

- intrusions    
- suspicious activity
- policy violations
- insider threats
    
## 3. Accountability

Every action is tied to a specific user.  
Nobody can say “It wasn’t me.”

👉 “If your account did it, YOU are responsible.”

# 🟨 What Accounting Tracks (Security+ List)

When you see this list in the exam — it’s ALWAYS Accounting.

### 1. Logging into a system
Who logged in, when, from where.

### 2. Accessing files
Which files were opened, read, copied.

### 3. Modifying configuration files
Changes to:
- system settings
- firewall rules
- registry
- router configs
    
### 4. Downloading or installing software
Installed apps, updates, patches.

### 5. Attempting unauthorized actions
Failed login attempts, blocked access, denied permissions.
All these form the audit trail.

# 🟥 Why Organizations Need Strong Accounting

## 1. Create a full Audit Trail

You can reconstruct “who did what, when, and how.”

## 2. Maintain Regulatory Compliance

Standards like:
- HIPAA    
- PCI-DSS
- GDPR
- SOX
…require proper accounting logs.

## 3. Do Forensic Analysis

If a breach happens, logs help investigators trace the attack.

## 4. Resource Optimization

Logs show:
- server usage    
- bandwidth usage
- storage hotspots  
Helps reduce cost and improve performance.
    
## 5. Achieve User Accountability

No more “I didn’t do it.”  
Logs prove actions beyond doubt.


# 🟦 How Accounting Is Performed (Tools)

### 1. Syslog Servers

Collect logs from:

- routers    
- switches
- firewalls
- Linux servers  
    Syslog centralizes ALL logs in one place.
    
### 2. Network Analysis Tools

Tools like:

- Wireshark
- Zeek
- NetFlow  
    Monitor network traffic and user actions across the network.
    
### 3. SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management)

THE MOST IMPORTANT for Security+.  
SIEMs:

- Collect logs    
- Correlate events
- Detect threats
- Generate alerts
- Create dashboards
    
Examples:
- Splunk
- QRadar
- ELK
- Azure Sentinel
- Wazuh
    
SIEM = Brain of Security Accounting.

# 🟩 In One Line:

Accounting = recording user actions to ensure transparency, security, and full accountability, using syslogs, network tools, and SIEM systems.
