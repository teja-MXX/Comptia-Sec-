# 🟩 1. What is Availability? (Feynman Style)

👉 Availability means your system/data must be accessible whenever you need it.
## Analogy:

A hospital emergency room must always stay open.  
If it closes even for 1 minute, people can die.
That’s availability.

# 🟢 2. What are “Nines of Availability”?

This is just a fancy way of saying how much uptime a system guarantees.

Example:
- 99.9% uptime
- 99.99% uptime
- 99.999% uptime
    
More nines → less downtime → more reliable.

## 🔢 Three 9’s Availability = 99.9% uptime

👉 Max downtime per year: 8.76 hours
This is called “three nines”.

## 🔠 Five 9’s Availability = 99.999% uptime

👉 Max downtime per year: about 5 minutes
This is the gold standard in critical systems (banks, hospitals, telecom).

# 🟨 Memory Trick:

- 3 nines → hours of downtime    
- 5 nines → minutes of downtime
    
# 🟣 3. How do we achieve Availability?

The best method = REDUNDANCY

👉 Redundancy = having backups of everything so even if one fails, another takes over.

### Analogy:
Two water tanks at home.  
If one runs dry, the other automatically supplies water → uninterrupted service.

# 🔵 4 Types of Redundancy (Super Simple)

## 1. Server Redundancy

👉 Multiple servers doing the same job.  
If one fails, another takes over.

Examples:
- Clustering
- Load balancing
- Failover servers
    
Analogy:  
Two doctors in ER — if one faints, the other continues.

## 2. Data Redundancy

👉 Extra copies of your data stored in different places.

Examples:
- RAID    
- Backups
- Replication
- Cloud copies

Analogy:  
Multiple copies of your tiffin recipes — even if one gets wet, you still have others.

## 3. Network Redundancy

👉 Alternative network paths so data can still flow if one link fails.

Examples:
- Dual ISPs
- Redundant routers
- Mesh network
- Multiple network cards (NIC bonding)
    
Analogy:  
Two roads to your house — if one is blocked, you use the other.

## 4. Power Redundancy

👉 Backup power sources so systems never go off.
Examples:
- UPS
- Generators
- Redundant power supplies in servers
    
Analogy:  
Power cut? Inverter kicks in immediately → continuous power.

# 🟧 In One Line Summary:

Availability = keeping systems up.  
More nines = less downtime.  
Redundancy = multiple backups of servers, data, network, and power.
