# 🟦 **1. Information Security (InfoSec)**

👉 Protects **the treasure** itself — the _information_ — no matter where it is.

### **Analogy:**

If someone asks:  
“Protect this gold, whether it’s in the castle, being transported, or written in a ledger.”
That’s **Information Security**.
### **Focuses on protecting data’s:**

- **Confidentiality** (nobody unauthorized sees it)
- **Integrity** (nobody unauthorized changes it)
- **Availability** (you can access it when needed)
  
### 📌 _Exam-friendly definition:_
**Information Security = protecting data whether it’s stored, processed, or transmitted.**

# 🟩 **2. Information _System_ Security (ISS)**

👉 Protects the **castle**, the **drawbridges**, the **walls**, and the **guards** — the _systems_ that handle the information.

### **Analogy:**

“Protect the castle (computers, networks, servers, applications) that holds the gold.”
That’s **Information System Security**.

### **Focuses on protecting:**

- Hardware (servers, laptops)
- Software (applications, OS)
- Networks (routers, switches)
- People and processes
- Entire IT ecosystem
### 📌 _Exam-friendly definition:_
**Information System Security = protecting the systems that store, process, and transmit information.**

# 🔐 **CIA Triad (Analogy: A Treasure Chest)**

### **1. Confidentiality = “Only the right people can open the chest.”**

Like a lock on a treasure box — only people with the key can see what's inside.

### **2. Integrity = “The treasure inside is untouched and not tampered with.”**

If someone swaps the gold with rocks, you’d know.  
Integrity means the data stays accurate and unaltered.

### **3. Availability = “You can open the chest whenever you need it.”**

A treasure chest is useless if it’s locked forever or buried too deep.  
Availability ensures the data is accessible when needed.

## 🟩 **In 3 words:**

**Confidentiality = Keep it secret**  
**Integrity = Keep it correct**  
**Availability = Keep it accessible**

# 🔐 **AAA — Think of a Nightclub Bouncer**

You’re trying to enter a nightclub.  
There are **3 steps** the bouncer follows:

## 🟦 **1. Authentication — “Prove who you are.”**

You show your **ID card**.

👉 Cyber equivalent: passwords, biometrics, OTPs.

## 🟩 **2. Authorization — “What are you allowed to do?”**

After entering the club,

- Some people can go to VIP section
- Some can only stay on the dance floor
    
👉 Cyber equivalent: permissions, access levels.

## 🟧 **3. Accounting — “We record what you did.”**

CCTV cameras and logbooks track:

- When you entered
- What rooms you accessed
- When you left
    
👉 Cyber equivalent: logs, audits, monitoring.

# 🔐 **Security Controls (Super Simple)**

👉 These are **things we put in place to protect something**.  
Like tools, actions, or measures that reduce risk.
## 🎯 **Analogy: Protecting Your House**

If your house were a computer system, security controls are:

- **Lock on the door**
- **CCTV camera**
- **Security guard**
- **Fire extinguisher**
- **Alarm system**
    
Each one is a **security control**.

They don’t eliminate risk — they **reduce** it.
