## 🌧 **Threat = The rain**

Something **bad that _could_ happen**.

- Hackers
- Malware
- Flood
- Power outage
- Insider attack
    
👉 A **threat** is an **outside danger**.


## 🕳 **Vulnerability = The hole in your roof**

A **weakness** that the threat can exploit.

- Weak passwords
- Unpatched system
- Open ports
- Misconfigurations
- No encryption
    
👉 A **vulnerability** is an **internal weakness**.

## 🔥 **In One Line:**

**Threat = something that can cause harm**  
**Vulnerability = a weakness that allows that harm**

So what is **risk**?

## 🔥 **Risk = the chance that the rain will enter through the hole and damage your house.**

👉 **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability**

If there is **rain** (threat) but **no hole** → zero risk.  
If there is **a hole** but **no rain** → zero risk.  
If both exist → risk appears.

## 🟨 **In One Line:**

**Risk = probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability + causing damage.**

# 🧠 **Super Simple Memory Trick:**

**Threat = danger  
Vulnerability = weakness  
Risk = chance of danger USING the weakness**
