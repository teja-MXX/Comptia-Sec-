# 🟩 Integrity (Feynman Style)

👉 **Integrity means the data stays correct, original, and untampered.**

# 🎯 Analogy:

Think of a **sealed tiffin box** your mom gives you.  
If someone opens it and changes the food,  
you’d know because the **seal is broken**.

That’s **Integrity** —  
**no unauthorized changes, and if something changes, you must detect it.**

# 🟦 5 Methods to Maintain Integrity (Super Simple)

## 1. Hashing
👉 Like taking a _fingerprint_ of the data.  
If data changes even one dot → fingerprint changes.

Example: SHA-256

## 2. Digital Signatures
👉 Like signing your name on a document.  
If someone changes the document → your signature becomes invalid.

Ensures **integrity + non-repudiation**.

## 3. File Permissions / Access Control
👉 Only certain people can edit the file.  
Like giving only mom the key to the tiffin box.

Controls **who can modify**.

## 4. Regular Audits
You compare every recipe with what it _should_ be and verify no changes happened.

👉 Purpose: **Verify data integrity and detect unauthorized changes.**

## 5. Checksums / CRC
👉 Math-based checks to detect accidental changes.  
Used in downloads, storage, networking.

Like counting the laddus before and after transport.
