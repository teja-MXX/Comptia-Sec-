# IT Governance – Standards (Feynman Style Notes)

## Role of Standards in Governance

Standards are a critical component of governance.  
They translate policies (what must be done) into specific, mandatory technical requirements (how it must be done).

Standards:

- Ensure consistency across the organization
    
- Enforce minimum security baselines
    
- Support auditability and compliance
    
- Reduce ambiguity in implementation
    

In this lesson, we focus on:

- Password standards
    
- Access control standards
    
- Physical security standards
    
- Encryption standards

## 1. Password Standards

### Definition

Password standards define mandatory requirements for password creation, usage, storage, and management.

### Purpose

- Protect against unauthorized access
    
- Resist brute-force and credential-based attacks
    
- Strengthen authentication controls
    

### Common Password Requirements

- Minimum length: typically 8–12 characters
    
- Complexity requirements:
    
    - Uppercase letters
        
    - Lowercase letters
        
    - Numbers
        
    - Special characters
        
- Password rotation:
    
    - Change every 60–90 days
        
- Password history:
    
    - Prevent reuse of previous passwords
        

### Password Protection Techniques

- Hashing: Converts passwords into irreversible fixed-length values
    
- Salting: Adds random data to passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks
    

### Key Outcome

Even if a password database is compromised, hashing and salting prevent attackers from recovering plaintext passwords.

## 2. Access Control Standards

### Definition

Access control standards define who can access what resources, under what conditions, and using which control models.

### Access Control Models

#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

- Resource owner determines access
    
- Common in operating systems like Windows and Linux
    

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

- Access based on labels and classifications
    
- Users cannot change permissions
    
- Common in government and military environments
    

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Access based on job roles
    
- Users receive permissions required for their role
    
- Common in enterprise environments
    

---

### Access Control Principles

#### Least Privilege

- Users are granted only the minimum access necessary
    
- Reduces attack surface and insider threat impact
    

#### Separation of Duties

- Critical tasks are split among multiple individuals
    
- Prevents fraud and abuse of power
    

### Key Outcome

Access control standards ensure controlled, accountable, and minimal access to organizational resources.

---

## 3. Physical Security Standards

### Definition

Physical security standards define mandatory physical controls used to protect systems, facilities, and information.

### Physical Security Controls

#### Perimeter Security

- Fences
    
- Gates
    
- Security guards
    

#### Surveillance

- CCTV cameras
    
- Monitoring systems
    

#### Physical Access Controls

- Key cards
    
- PIN pads
    
- Biometric scanners
    

---

### Environmental Controls

- Fire suppression systems
    
- HVAC systems
    
- Power redundancy (UPS, generators)
    

### Secure Areas

- Server rooms
- Data centers
    
These areas require:

- Restricted access
- Enhanced monitoring
- Additional authentication controls
    

### Key Outcome

Physical security standards protect against theft, tampering, environmental damage, and unauthorized physical access.

---

## 4. Encryption Standards

### Definition

Encryption standards define approved cryptographic algorithms and methods used to protect data confidentiality.

### Purpose

- Protect data from unauthorized disclosure
- Secure data at rest and in transit
    

---

### Common Encryption Standards

#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

- Symmetric encryption
- Strong security and high performance
- Commonly used for data at rest
    

#### RSA

- Asymmetric encryption
- Uses public/private key pairs
- Commonly used for secure communications and key exchange
    

### Selection Considerations

- Security strength
- Performance impact
- Use case (data at rest vs data in transit)
    

### Key Outcome

Even if data is intercepted or accessed illegally, encryption renders it unreadable.

---

## Key Exam Takeaways

- Standards are mandatory
- Password standards → authentication security
- Access control standards → authorization enforcement
- Physical security standards → protection of facilities and systems
- Encryption standards → data confidentiality

## Final Feynman Summary

Standards operationalize governance.  
They define exact technical requirements that ensure security controls are implemented consistently, correctly, and measurably across the organization.

Policies say what must be protected.  
Standards say exactly how protection must be implemented.

## A Practical Story — How Standards Actually Work Inside an Organization

MedCore Solutions has good policies, but policies alone are not enough. Ananya learns this quickly when she joins the **security operations team**. Policies say _what_ the organization believes in — but **standards decide exactly how things are done**.

### Password Standards — Where Security Starts

On her first week, Ananya helps onboard a new employee. When the employee tries to set a simple password, the system rejects it immediately.

The password must:

- Be **8–12 characters long**
    
- Contain **uppercase and lowercase letters**
    
- Include **numbers and special characters**
    
- Not match any of the last few passwords used
    

The employee complains about changing passwords often, but the system enforces a **60–90 day rotation** automatically.

Later, during a security briefing, Ananya learns why this exists. Passwords are the **first line of defense** against unauthorized access and brute-force attacks. Behind the scenes, even the passwords stored in the system are not readable — they are **hashed and salted**.

So even if someone steals the password database, the actual passwords remain protected.

This isn’t preference. It’s a **password standard**, and everyone follows it.

---

### Access Control Standards — Who Gets Access and Why

A developer requests access to multiple internal systems “just in case.” Ananya reviews the request and applies **access control standards**.

Different systems use different models:

- In one internal folder, the **owner decides who gets access** — this follows **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**.
    
- In a classified healthcare reporting system, access is granted based on **labels and classifications**, not personal choice — this is **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**, commonly used in government-like environments.
    
- Most business systems rely on **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. Developers get developer access. Finance gets finance access. No overlap unless justified.
    

Ananya also checks two critical rules:

- **Least privilege** — users get only the minimum access required to do their job.
    
- **Separation of duties** — no single person can approve, execute, and audit the same critical action.
    

This prevents both mistakes and insider threats — not by trust, but by standard.

### Physical Security Standards — Protecting What You Can Touch

One evening, Ananya walks past the data center floor with a visitor. They stop at the door — access denied.

Why?

Because **physical security standards** apply just as strictly as digital ones.

The building uses:

- **Perimeter security** — fences, gates, guards
    
- **Surveillance systems** — CCTV monitoring all entry points
    
- **Access controls** — key cards and biometric scanners
    

Inside the data center:

- Only authorized personnel can enter
    
- Server rooms have stricter controls than office areas
    
- Environmental protections are in place:
    
    - Fire suppression systems
        
    - HVAC controls
        
    - Power redundancy systems
        

These standards ensure systems are protected from theft, tampering, fire, overheating, and power failure — risks that malware alone doesn’t cause.

### Encryption Standards — Protecting Data Even When It Leaks

One day, a security alert shows unusual traffic leaving the network. The SOC investigates.

The relief comes quickly: **the data is encrypted**.

Because MedCore follows **encryption standards**, even intercepted data is unreadable.

The organization enforces:

- **AES** for data stored on disks and databases (data at rest)
    
- **RSA** for secure communication and key exchange (data in transit)
    

AES is chosen for its **strong security and efficient performance**, especially for stored data.  
RSA is used where **public key infrastructure** is required for secure communication.

The choice of encryption isn’t random — it’s based on **use case and performance balance**, exactly as the standard defines.

### The Reality Ananya Learns

At MedCore, standards are not optional.  
They are **mandatory, specific, and enforced**.

- Password standards stop brute-force attacks
    
- Access control standards prevent overreach and insider risk
    
- Physical security standards protect real-world assets
    
- Encryption standards protect data even after failure
    

Policies say _“we care about security.”_  
**Standards say _how security is actually implemented_.**

That’s the difference Ananya now understands.
