# IT Governance – Policies (Feynman Style Notes)

## Role of Policies in IT Governance

In IT governance, policies form the backbone of how an organization operates securely and consistently.  
They define rules, expectations, and boundaries that guide employee behavior, system usage, and compliance with laws and regulations.

Policies:

- Enable consistent decision-making
    
- Reduce security and legal risk
    
- Ensure regulatory and contractual compliance
    
- Provide direction for standards and procedures

## A Practical IT Governance Story — Policies in Action

Ananya works in IT operations at **MedCore Solutions**, a healthcare software company. MedCore handles patient records, billing systems, and doctor portals. Because of this, the company is heavily regulated and takes IT governance seriously.

### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) — The First Line of Control

On Ananya’s first day, before she even gets her laptop, HR makes her sign the **Acceptable Use Policy**.

A week later, one employee tries to install a free PDF converter from an unknown website on a company laptop. The system blocks the installation automatically, and the SOC team gets an alert.

When the employee asks IT why it was blocked, Ananya explains that company systems cannot be used to download unauthorized software or access risky websites. This isn’t personal — it’s policy. The AUP exists to protect the company from malware, legal trouble, and misuse of resources.

Because the boundaries are clearly defined, there’s no argument. Everyone knows what is allowed and what isn’t.

---

### Information Security Policy — Protecting What Matters

One afternoon, a developer asks Ananya for access to the production database containing patient data. Ananya doesn’t approve it immediately.

She checks the **information security policy**.

The policy clearly states:

- Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
    
- Access is granted only on a need-to-know basis
    
- Only authorized roles can access production data
    

Since the developer only needs test data, access is denied. Instead, sanitized data is provided.

This policy silently protects **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** every day — even when no one notices.

---

### Business Continuity Policy — When Things Go Wrong

One night, a power failure hits the city where MedCore’s main office is located. Office systems go down, employees can’t log in, and customer support calls start coming in.

But business doesn’t stop.

Because of the **business continuity policy**, employees know exactly what to do:

- Critical staff switch to remote access
    
- Customer-facing systems run from backup infrastructure
    
- Priority services stay online
    

The policy isn’t about fixing systems — it’s about **continuing operations** no matter what.

Patients still get reports. Doctors still log in. Business continues.

---

### Disaster Recovery Policy — Getting IT Back

While business continuity keeps operations running, the IT team activates the **disaster recovery policy**.

Ananya follows documented steps:

- Restore systems from offsite backups
    
- Validate data integrity
    
- Bring backup servers online
    
- Test systems before full production use
    

The policy already defines backup frequency, recovery procedures, and alternate locations. No panic. No guessing.

Within hours, systems are fully restored.

---

### Incident Response Policy — When Security Is Breached

Two weeks later, the SOC detects suspicious outbound traffic. An investigation confirms a **data breach attempt**.

Ananya doesn’t improvise.

She follows the **incident response policy**:

- Detect and report the incident
    
- Notify the incident response team
    
- Contain the affected system
    
- Investigate root cause
    
- Document lessons learned
    

The policy clearly states who must be notified, how containment happens, and how future incidents are prevented.

Because of this structured response, damage is minimized and compliance requirements are met.

---

### SDLC Policy — Building Secure Software

Meanwhile, the development team is working on a new patient portal.

They can’t just code and deploy.

The **SDLC policy** requires:

- Requirements gathering
    
- Secure design
    
- Code reviews
    
- Security testing
    
- Controlled deployment
    
- Ongoing maintenance
    

During testing, a vulnerability is found and fixed before release. No customer ever sees it.

The policy ensures that security is built **into** software — not added later.

---

### Change Management Policy — Preventing Chaos

One Friday evening, a senior engineer wants to push a quick configuration change to production.

Ananya stops it.

According to the **change management policy**, changes must:

- Be formally requested
    
- Approved
    
- Tested
    
- Scheduled
    
- Reviewed after implementation
    

The change is delayed until Monday. During testing, they discover it would have broken authentication for hundreds of users.

A disaster avoided — not by skill, but by policy.

---

### The Bigger Picture

At MedCore Solutions, policies are not documents sitting in a folder.

They:

- Control user behavior (AUP)
    
- Protect data (Information Security)
    
- Keep business alive (Business Continuity)
    
- Restore systems (Disaster Recovery)
    
- Handle attacks (Incident Response)
    
- Build secure software (SDLC)
    
- Prevent reckless changes (Change Management)
    

Ananya doesn’t memorize these policies for exams.

She **lives them every day**.

And this is exactly how IT governance works in the real world.
