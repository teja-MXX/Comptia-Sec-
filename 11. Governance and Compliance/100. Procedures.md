## Story: Procedures at TechCore Solutions

**TechCore Solutions** is a mid-sized IT company that develops cloud software for clients worldwide. Over the years, the management has realized that **policies and standards alone are not enough**—procedures are what make operations smooth, consistent, and safe.


### 1. Change Management Procedure in Action

TechCore decides to **upgrade its internal project management software** to improve efficiency. The IT team follows the **change management procedure** step by step:

1. **Identify the need:** The current software is slow and incompatible with new reporting requirements.
    
2. **Assess impacts:** The IT manager lists which departments and processes will be affected.
    
3. **Plan the change:** A detailed schedule is created, assigning responsibilities and resources.
    
4. **Test the change:** A pilot version is rolled out for a single department to detect issues early.
    
5. **Schedule implementation:** The full rollout is scheduled over a weekend maintenance window to minimize disruption.
    
6. **Implement:** The upgrade is done in stages across departments.
    
7. **Review and record:** After completion, the IT team evaluates the upgrade, documents lessons learned, and updates the procedure for future changes.
    

Because the **change management procedure** exists, the upgrade is smooth, employees experience minimal disruption, and nothing critical is overlooked.


### 2. Onboarding Procedure: Welcoming New Employees

A new developer, **Riya**, joins TechCore. The **onboarding procedure** ensures she becomes productive quickly:

- **Orientation:** She is introduced to the company culture, teams, and policies.
    
- **Training:** She learns the development environment, coding standards, and cybersecurity protocols.
    
- **Integration:** Mentorship sessions and team projects help her settle in.
    

By following the procedure, Riya quickly becomes a contributing member of the team without any confusion or missed steps.


### 3. Offboarding Procedure: Smooth Employee Exit

After two years, **Anil**, a senior engineer, decides to resign. TechCore uses the **offboarding procedure**:

- **Retrieve company property:** Laptop, access cards, and devices are returned.
    
- **Disable access:** All system accounts, VPN access, and email credentials are revoked.
    
- **Exit interview:** Feedback is gathered to improve future operations.
    

The **offboarding procedure** ensures TechCore protects its data and assets while learning from departing employees.

### 4. Playbooks: Responding to Incidents

One night, TechCore’s **security operations team** detects unusual login attempts on a critical server. They open the **incident response playbook**, which provides:

- **Checklist of actions:** Steps to identify, contain, and investigate the incident.
    
- **Resource guide:** Tools and contacts needed for resolution.
    
- **Expected outcomes:** Clear goals to restore security and operations quickly.
    

Thanks to the playbook, the team responds **quickly and consistently**, preventing a potential breach without panic or mistakes.
