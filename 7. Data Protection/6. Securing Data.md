# ✅ Feynman-Style Notes: Data Security Methods (Complete & Technical)

## 1. Geographic Restrictions (Geofencing)

What it is:  
A security control that restricts data access based on the geographic location of the user/system.

Technical Explanation:

- Uses IP ranges (GeoIP databases) to allow or deny requests.
    
- Defines “virtual boundaries” → e.g., allow only IPs from the Americas.
    
- Helps comply with data sovereignty laws (laws that say data must stay within certain countries).
    
- Blocks login attempts from high-risk regions to reduce fraud.
    

Example:  
If your company operates only in the US + Canada, then logins from Asia or Africa are automatically blocked.

## 2. Encryption

What it is:  
A reversible transformation of plaintext → ciphertext using an algorithm + key.

Technical Points:

- Uses ciphers (AES, RSA, ECC, ChaCha20).
    
- Requires encryption key and decryption key.
    
- Two forms:
    
    - Data at rest (HDD, SSD, DB)
        
    - Data in transit (TLS, HTTPS, VPN)
        

Important:  
Encryption protects confidentiality even if an attacker steals the data.

## 3. Hashing

What it is:  
A one-way, irreversible function that converts input → fixed-length hash.

Technical Points:

- Algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2.
    
- One-way → impossible to decrypt.
    
- Used for:
    
    - Password storage
        
    - File integrity verification
        
    - Digital signatures (part of them)
        

Properties:

- Deterministic (same input → same hash)
    
- Avalanche effect (tiny change → completely different hash)

## 4. Data Masking

What it is:  
Replacing sensitive data with placeholder symbols (X, *, etc.) while keeping format or partial metadata.

Technical Explanation:

- One-way transformation.
    
- Used for analytics, testing, or displaying partial data.
    
- Maintains format-preserving structure (same field length/type).
    
- Types:
    
    - Static masking: masking at rest
        
    - Dynamic masking: masking during access based on user privileges
        

Example:  
`9876543210` → `987-XXX-XX10`

## 5. Tokenization

What it is:  
Replacing sensitive data with a unique token, while original data is stored in a secure token vault.

Difference vs Masking:

- Masking destroys reversibility.
    
- Tokenization can be reversed _only with access to the token vault_.
    

Technical Points:

- The token has no mathematical relationship with original data.
    
- Used in payment systems (PCI DSS) → credit card processing.
    
- The token is useless without the mapping table/vault.
    

Example:  
Credit card `4111 1111 1111 1111` → token `TKN-98AF22`

## 6. Obfuscation

What it is:  
Making data/code intentionally unclear, confusing, or unreadable.

Technical Explanation:

- Goal → reduce human understanding, not prevent mathematical reversal.
    
- Used for:
    
    - Source code protection
        
    - Hiding internal fields/variables
        
    - API request obfuscation
        
- Techniques include:
    
    - Variable renaming
        
    - Encoding
        
    - Pseudonymization
        
    - Light encryption
        
    - Data scrambling
        

Note:  
Obfuscation ≠ encryption  
Obfuscation ≠ strong protection  
It slows attackers, doesn’t fully stop them.

## 7. Segmentation (Network Segmentation)

What it is:  
Dividing a network into isolated segments so a breach doesn't spread.

Technical Explanation:

- Uses VLANs, subnets, firewalls, ACLs, micro-segmentation.
    
- Controls lateral movement (like preventing an attacker from moving from HR segment to Finance segment).
    
- Each segment has separate security controls (IAM, firewalls, IDS/IPS).
    

Why useful:  
Even if attacker breaks into one zone, they cannot pivot to others.

---

## 8. Permission Restrictions (Access Control)

What it is:  
Defining _who_ can access _what_ data and _what actions_ they can perform.

Technical Explanation:

- Enforced through:
    
    - ACLs (Access Control Lists)
        
    - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
        
    - ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
        

Goal:  
Limit data access to only those who truly need it (principle of least privilege).

Example:

- Finance role → can read employee salaries
    
- HR role → cannot view company financial accounts

# ⭐ Final Summary (All Concepts Combined)

To protect data, organizations use a layered security approach.  
The transcript describes 8 key techniques:

1. Geographic restrictions → block access by location
    
2. Encryption → reversible confidentiality protection
    
3. Hashing → irreversible integrity protection
    
4. Masking → hide data while preserving format
    
5. Tokenization → replace sensitive data with reversible tokens
    
6. Obfuscation → make data/code harder to understand
    
7. Segmentation → isolate network areas
    
8. Permission restrictions → restrict who can access what
    

These work together to prevent:

- External attacks
    
- Internal breaches
    
- Compliance violations
    
- Data leakage
    
- Unauthorized access
    
- Lateral movement
