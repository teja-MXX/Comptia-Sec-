# ✅ Feynman-Style Notes: Data States & How to Protect Them (Technical First)

There are three states of data you must secure:

1. Data at Rest
2. Data in Transit (Data in Motion)
3. Data in Use
    
Each state has different risks and therefore different protection mechanisms.


# 🔵 1. DATA AT REST

### Definition (Technical)

Data that is stored in a database, file system, server, hard drive, SSD, backup drive, or cloud storage and not currently moving across a network or being actively processed.

Because it's static, attackers often target it (easier to steal).

### Main Protection Technique: Encryption

Encryption → converts data to unreadable ciphertext that requires a decryption key.

### 🔶 Types of Encryption for Data at Rest

You mentioned all of these — I’m preserving them exactly, just simplifying the explanation.


## 1️⃣ Full Disk Encryption (FDE)

- Encrypts the entire disk.
- When system is OFF → disk is encrypted (locked)
- When system is ON + user authenticated → disk auto-decrypts
    
Examples: BitLocker, FileVault, LUKS.
Use-case: Protect laptops if stolen.


## 2️⃣ Partition Encryption

- Encrypts specific partitions (e.g., only D:\ or E:).
- Other partitions remain unencrypted.
    
Use-case: Encrypt only your sensitive work partition, leave OS unencrypted.


## 3️⃣ File Encryption

- Encrypts individual files.
- Useful for securing only specific sensitive files.
    
Use-case: Encrypt one confidential PDF, one key file, etc.


## 4️⃣ Volume Encryption (Folder/Container Encryption)

- Encrypts a collection of files/folders as one encrypted volume/container.

Example: VeraCrypt volume.
Use-case: Secure an entire folder of project files together.

## 5️⃣ Database Encryption

- Encrypts data inside a database.
- Can be applied to:
    - Entire table
    - Specific rows
    - Specific columns
    
Use-case: Encrypt all values in the "credit_card_number" column.

## 6️⃣ Record/Field Encryption

- Encrypt specific fields inside a single database record.
- Useful when many users access the same record but shouldn't see all fields.
    
Example: HR can view salary field → encrypted; regular employees cannot.

### Additional Controls (mentioned in your text)

- ACLs (Access Control Lists) → restrict who can read/write the data.


# 🔵 2. DATA IN TRANSIT (Data in Motion)

### Definition (Technical)

Data that is actively moving over a network:

- Internet
- Internal LAN
- Between systems or applications
    
Exposure risk: interception, sniffing, MITM attacks.

### Main Protection Technique: Communication Encryption
Your text listed the three mechanisms — here they are explained cleanly:

## 1️⃣ SSL/TLS

- Cryptographic protocols for securing communication between client ↔ server.
- Used in:
    
    - HTTPS websites
    - Email
    - API calls
    - File transfers
        
Technical function: encrypts data between endpoints to prevent interception.


## 2️⃣ VPN (Virtual Private Network)

- Creates a secure encrypted tunnel over an insecure network (internet).
- Protects all data passing through the tunnel.
    
Use-case: remote employees connecting to office network.


## 3️⃣ IPsec

- Secures IP packets (layer 3).
- Provides:
    - Encryption
    - Authentication
    - Integrity
        
Used in:

- Site-to-site VPNs
- Secure internal communication
    


# 🔵 3. DATA IN USE

### Definition (Technical)

Data that is currently being processed, meaning:

- Being created
- Being retrieved
- Being modified
- Being deleted
- Being loaded into RAM for application use
    
Data must often be decrypted to be processed, making it a vulnerable state.

### Why is it hard to protect?

Because the system must read the plaintext, attackers may target:

- RAM
- CPU registers
- Application memory
- Active processes
    
### Protection Mechanisms

## 1️⃣ Application-Level Encryption

- Data is encrypted/decrypted within the application logic, not at disk or OS level.
- Ensures only the app (not the OS) can access plaintext.
    

## 2️⃣ Access Controls (ACL, RBAC, ABAC)

- Restrict which users or processes can access the data.
    
Example: only a certain service account can decrypt credit card numbers.


## 3️⃣ Secure Enclaves / Trusted Execution Environments

Technical: hardware-based isolated CPU regions where data is processed securely.

Examples:
- Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions)
- ARM TrustZone
    
Purpose: even if the OS is compromised, enclave data stays protected.


## 4️⃣ Memory Encryption

Some technologies encrypt data while in RAM so other processes can't read it.

Example from your text:
- _Intel Software Guard can encrypt data in memory so untrusted processes cannot decode it._
