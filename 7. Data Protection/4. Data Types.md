# ✅ Feynman-Style Notes: Types of Data & How They Must Be Protected

Data is the core asset of any organization. It drives decisions, enables innovation, and helps understand operations.  
But not all data is the same — different data types require different levels of protection and are governed by different laws.

This lesson covers:

- Regulated Data
    
- PII
    
- PHI
    
- Trade Secrets
    
- Intellectual Property (IP)
    
- Legal Information
    
- Financial Information
    
- Human-Readable vs Non-Human-Readable Data

# 🔵 1. Regulated Data

### Definition (Technical)

Regulated data = any information controlled by a law, regulation, or industry standard.

Examples:

- PII (Personal Identifiable Information)
    
- PHI (Protected Health Information)
    
- Credit card data
    

Organizations MUST follow legal requirements such as:

- GDPR (European Union)
    
- HIPAA (United States healthcare)
    
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry)
    

Failure to comply → heavy fines, lawsuits, loss of trust.

# 🔵 2. PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

### Definition (Technical)

PII = data that can uniquely identify an individual, either directly or indirectly.

Examples:

- Full name
    
- Social Security Number
    
- Email, phone number
    
- Address
    
- Passport number
    

### Why is PII important?

- Highly valuable to attackers for identity theft
    
- Strict privacy laws mandate strong protection
    
- Must be secured using encryption, access controls, and data minimization

# 🔵 3. PHI (Protected Health Information)

### Definition (Technical)

PHI = any health-related information linked to a specific person, including:

- Medical history
    
- Diagnoses
    
- Treatment records
    
- Insurance or billing documents
    

PHI is protected under HIPAA in the US.

### PHI includes anything that reveals:

- A person’s health condition
    
- The care they received
    
- How they paid for the care
    

Because PHI is extremely sensitive, its protection requirements are very strict.

# 🔵 4. Trade Secrets

### Definition (Technical)

Trade secrets = confidential business information that gives a company a competitive advantage.

Examples:

- Manufacturing processes
    
- Algorithms
    
- Proprietary software code
    
- Marketing strategies
    
- Supplier/customer lists
    

Trade secrets are protected by:

- Trade secret laws
    
- Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)
    
- Internal security controls
    

Unauthorized disclosure → major legal penalties.

---

# 🔵 5. Intellectual Property (IP)

### Definition (Technical)

Intellectual Property = creations of the mind. Protected through legal rights to encourage innovation.

Types:

- Patents → inventions, processes
    
- Copyright → written, visual, audio, digital content (ex: course videos)
    
- Trademarks → logos, symbols, brand identifiers
    

Unauthorized use or copying → legal violations.

Example:  
A company’s training videos are IP. Downloading them and posting elsewhere is illegal.

---

# 🔵 6. Legal Information

### Definition

Data related to legal proceedings, contracts, compliance documents, or attorney communications.

Examples:

- Case files
    
- Client communications
    
- Regulatory documents
    
- Evidence files
    
- Corporate contracts
    

### Why it is sensitive

- Covered under _legal professional privilege_
    
- Leaks can cause lawsuits, financial loss, or reputation damage
    

Protection requires:

- Strong access controls
    
- Encryption
    
- Audit trails
    

---

# 🔵 7. Financial Information

### Definition

Data involving an organization’s financial transactions or monetary details.

Examples:

- Sales records
    
- Tax documents
    
- Bank statements
    
- Payroll files
    
- Invoice histories
    

Attackers target this data for:

- Fraud
    
- Money theft
    
- Identity theft
    

### Regulation

Credit card data must comply with:

- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
    

Financial data requires strong controls such as:

- Encryption
    
- Network segmentation
    
- Strict authentication
    
- Logging and monitoring
    

---

# 🔵 8. Human-Readable vs Non-Human-Readable Data

### 1️⃣ Human-Readable Data

Information humans can read _without_ software.

Examples:

- Text files
    
- PDFs
    
- Spreadsheets
    
- Email documents
    

Threat: easy to interpret if exposed.

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Human-Readable Data

Information that requires software/machines to decode.

Examples:

- Binary files
    
- Machine code
    
- Encoded data formats
    

Even though humans cannot read it directly, it still requires protection — attackers can decode or misuse it.

# 🔵 Final Summary (Exam-Oriented)

### Regulated Data:

Data controlled by laws (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). Includes PII, PHI, credit card data.

### PII:

Identifies a person (name, SSN, address). Strictly regulated.

### PHI:

Health-related data tied to a person. Protected by HIPAA.

### Trade Secrets:

Confidential business info providing competitive edge (algorithms, formulas). Legal protection.

### Intellectual Property:

Creative works (courses, programs, designs). Protected by copyright, patents, trademarks.

### Legal Information:

Contracts, case files, privileged communications. Requires high confidentiality.

### Financial Information:

Tax, bank, payroll, invoices. Target for fraud. Regulated by PCI DSS.

### Human vs Non-Human Readable Data:

Human-readable (text) vs machine-readable (binary). Both must be protected.
