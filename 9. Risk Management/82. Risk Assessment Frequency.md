# Risk Assessment Frequency (Improved & Polished Version)

Risk assessment frequency refers to how often an organization conducts risk assessments.  
The appropriate frequency varies depending on:

- The nature of the organization
    
- The type of risks involved
    
- The rate of change in internal and external environments
    

There are four main types of risk assessment frequencies:

---

# 1. Ad Hoc Risk Assessments

Ad hoc risk assessments are conducted as needed, usually triggered by a specific event or situation that may introduce new risks or modify existing ones.

Ad hoc assessments may occur when an organization:

- Launches a new product
    
- Enters a new market
    
- Experiences a natural disaster
    
- Faces a major regulatory or legal change
    

They are event-driven and not part of a scheduled cycle.

# 2. Recurring Risk Assessments

Recurring risk assessments happen on a regular schedule, such as:

- Monthly
    
- Quarterly
    
- Annually
    

These are built into the organization’s standard operating procedures.

Examples:

- A financial institution performing recurring assessments for credit risk, market risk, and operational risk
    
- A cybersecurity team conducting recurring penetration tests to regularly check for new vulnerabilities
    

The purpose: continual identification, analysis, and management of risk.

# 3. One-Time Risk Assessments

One-time assessments are performed for a specific purpose and not repeated once that purpose is fulfilled.

Examples:

- Implementing a new IT system
    
- Starting a major construction project
    
- Planning organizational restructuring
    

These assessments are tied to a project or initiative, not an event.

### Difference: Ad Hoc vs. One-Time Risk Assessments

This distinction is important:

|One-Time Assessment|Ad Hoc Assessment|
|---|---|
|Connected to a specific project|Triggered by a specific event|
|Not repeated|May be repeated if similar events occur again|
|Planned before a project starts|Reactive to sudden/internal/external changes|

---

# 4. Continuous Risk Assessments

Continuous risk assessments involve ongoing, real-time monitoring supported by technology.  
They rely on continuous data collection and automated analysis.

Example:

- A cybersecurity team monitoring threats, vulnerabilities, and system behavior in real time using SIEM tools, IDS/IPS, or automated analytics
    

Purpose: enable immediate detection and response.

# Summary

|Type|Trigger|Frequency|Purpose|
|---|---|---|---|
|Ad Hoc|Specific events|As needed|Respond to sudden changes or risk triggers|
|Recurring|Organizational schedule|Regular (monthly, quarterly, yearly)|Ongoing, routine risk evaluation|
|One-Time|Unique projects|Once|Assess project-specific risks|
|Continuous|Technology-driven monitoring|Real-time|Constant oversight and fast detection|

Each frequency serves a different purpose, and organizations typically use a combination of all four to maintain a strong and resilient risk management program.
