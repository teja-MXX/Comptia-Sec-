# Qualitative Risk Analysis — Complete Technical Notes (Feynman Style)

Qualitative Risk Analysis is one of the fundamental methods in risk management. It focuses on evaluating risks based on likelihood and impact, but without using numerical formulas, statistics, or calculations. Instead, it uses expert judgment, experience, and categorization.

Let’s break it down.

---

# 1. What is Qualitative Risk Analysis?

Qualitative Risk Analysis is a non-numerical, category-based method of assessing risks.

It answers two questions:

1. How likely is this risk to occur?
    
2. How severe will the impact be if it happens?
    

It uses labels like:

- Low
    
- Medium
    
- High
    

Instead of mathematical values.

This method:

- is simple,
    
- is fast,
    
- relies heavily on team experience,
    
- avoids the complexity of quantitative analysis,
    
- is ideal in early phases of projects or when precise numerical data isn’t available.

# 2. Key Concepts in Qualitative Analysis

## (1) Likelihood / Probability

Likelihood = the chance that a risk will occur.

It is expressed as:

- Low
    
- Medium
    
- High
    

Likelihood assessment is based on:

- historical data
    
- expert knowledge
    
- past experience
    
- similar project outcomes
    
- environment and industry patterns
    

Example:

- “Medium likelihood” = this risk has a reasonable chance of occurring, but it’s not guaranteed.
    

---

## (2) Impact

Impact = the severity of consequences if the risk actually happens.

It is also expressed as:

- Low
    
- Medium
    
- High
    

Impact assessment considers effects on:

- cost
    
- schedule
    
- quality
    
- compliance
    
- performance
    
- safety
    

Impact levels:

- Low Impact → Minor loss; operations continue with slight inconvenience
    
- Medium Impact → Noticeable disruption; costs, delays, or quality issues occur
    
- High Impact → Major disruption; essential functions cannot be performed
    

Impact helps determine how much damage the organization will suffer.

# 3. How Qualitative Risk Analysis Works (Real Technical Flow)

1. Identify the risk
    
2. Assess likelihood (Low/Medium/High)
    
3. Assess impact (Low/Medium/High)
    
4. Combine both to categorize the risk
    
5. Prioritize the risk
    
6. Develop mitigation or contingency strategies
    

This helps managers decide which risks deserve immediate attention.

---

# 4. Real Examples

## Example 1 — Software Development Project

Risk: A key developer leaving mid-project.

- Likelihood: Medium
    
    - because employee turnover is common
        
- Impact: High
    
    - because loss of specialized knowledge causes delays, cost increase, quality issues
        

What the project manager would do:

- Cross-train multiple team members
    
- Document procedures and knowledge
    
- Improve retention strategies
    

This reduces dependency on a single person.

## Example 2 — Construction Project

Risk: Delay in delivery of critical building materials.

- Likelihood: High
    
    - due to common supply chain disruptions
        
    - vendor reliability
        
    - weather and transportation delays
        
- Impact: High
    
    - project delays
        
    - cost overruns
        
    - contractual penalties
        

Mitigation strategies:

- Multiple suppliers
    
- Early scheduling
    
- Maintaining buffer stock
    

This keeps the project moving even if one vendor fails.

# Final Summary — What You Must Remember

### Qualitative Risk Analysis

A method of rating risks based on impact and likelihood, using descriptive scales instead of numbers.

### Likelihood

The probability that a risk will occur.  
Rated as: Low / Medium / High

### Impact

The severity of the consequences if the risk occurs.  
Rated as: Low / Medium / High

### Why It’s Important

No matter the industry—software, construction, cybersecurity, finance—qualitative risk analysis is essential for navigating uncertainty, prioritizing risks, and protecting project objectives.

# 🎬 STORY: “The Spaceship That Almost Didn’t Launch”

_(Qualitative Risk Analysis explained like Feynman)_

Alright kid, listen.  
NASA is building a brand-new spacecraft — sleek, shiny, and expensive enough to make accountants faint. Everyone wants this thing to fly, but before it even smells rocket fuel, there’s a meeting.

Not a fancy engineering meeting.  
Not a math meeting.  
A _“What can go wrong?”_ meeting.

And _that_, kid, is where qualitative risk analysis walks in.

---

## 🎬 Scene 1 — The Whiteboard of Doom

Dr. Eleanor, the project manager, writes a huge title on the board:

> “QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS — TODAY WE GUESS SMARTLY.”

Some young engineer looks confused.

Dr. Eleanor smiles and says:

> “We’re not doing math today.  
> No equations.  
> No simulations.  
> Today is about good judgment — the stuff we learned from years of watching the universe try to break our toys.”

That’s the heart of qualitative risk analysis:

➡️ You don’t calculate risk with numbers.  
➡️ You _describe_ it: Low, Medium, High.  
➡️ And you decide what deserves attention.

Simple, right? Good. Keep listening.

## 🎬 Scene 2 — Three Types of Bad News

Dr. Eleanor draws two columns:

### 1. Likelihood

“How likely is this thing to go wrong?”

- Low
    
- Medium
    
- High
    

### 2. Impact

“If it does go wrong, how hard does it punch us?”

- Low
    
- Medium
    
- High
    

Every risk goes through these two doors.

---

## 🎬 Scene 3 — The First Risk: The Genius Engineer Might Quit

An engineer nervously speaks up:

> “Um… what if our lead navigation expert quits?”

Dr. Eleanor nods.

- Likelihood: “Medium — people quit jobs, especially smart ones.”
    
- Impact: “High — without him, the spaceship goes nowhere.”
    

Dr. Eleanor circles it in red.

Kid, notice something?

No formulas.  
No charts.  
Just clear judgment.

That’s qualitative risk analysis.

---

## 🎬 Scene 4 — The Second Risk: Materials Delayed

Another voice:

> “The titanium delivery might get delayed. Supplier is unreliable.”

They evaluate:

- Likelihood: High
    
- Impact: High  
    (A delayed spacecraft = millions lost and deadlines ruined)
    

They mark it as a priority risk.

---

## 🎬 Scene 5 — The Third Risk: Coffee Machine Breaking

Someone jokes:

> “What if the coffee machine breaks again?”

Dr. Eleanor laughs.

- Likelihood: High
    
- Impact: Low
    

She writes:

> “Annoying, but the rocket won’t explode because of caffeine withdrawal.”

This stays green — low priority.

See? That’s the beauty of qualitative analysis:  
You don’t waste time solving problems that don’t matter.

---

## 🎬 Scene 6 — Turning Risk into Action

Dr. Eleanor points at the board:

- Medium likelihood × high impact → needs mitigation
    
- High likelihood × high impact → needs priority mitigation
    
- Low likelihood × low impact → ignore for now
    

They start making plans:

### For the engineer quitting:

- Cross-train two juniors
    
- Make him document everything
    
- Increase retention benefits
    

### For titanium delays:

- Add a second supplier
    
- Increase buffer stock
    
- Schedule deliveries earlier
    

And just like that, risks are no longer scary.  
They’re manageable.

---

## 🎬 Scene 7 — The Launch

Months later, something _does_ happen:

- The key engineer gets dengue — out for 3 weeks.
    
- Titanium shipment gets delayed by 10 days.
    

But the team doesn’t panic.

Why?

Because during qualitative risk analysis, they already planned for both.

The spaceship launches beautifully — no explosions, no chaos.

Dr. Eleanor turns to the team:

> “Kid, that’s the power of asking the simplest question in the world:
> 
> ‘How likely is it? And how bad is it?’”
