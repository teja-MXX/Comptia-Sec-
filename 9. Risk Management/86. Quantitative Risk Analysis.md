# Feynman-Style Notes — Quantitative Risk Analysis

Alright kid, listen.

Risk isn't magic. It's math.  
Quantitative Risk Analysis is simply asking:

“If something bad happens, how much money do we lose—and how often?”

No drama. Just numbers.

---

# 1. What is Quantitative Risk Analysis?

A numerical method to evaluate risk.

- It gives probabilistic predictions of future events.
    
- It is used in financial decisions, safety planning, scheduling, and cybersecurity.
    
- The goal is to produce objective, measurable values, not vague guesses.
    

Instead of saying:

> “That server crash would be bad.”

We say:

> “That crash costs exactly $X each time, and happens Y times per year.”

---

# 2. The Four Core Components

## a) Exposure Factor (EF)

“How much of the asset is destroyed in one incident?”

- A percentage: 0% → 100%
    
- 0% = no damage
    
- 100% = total loss
    

Example:  
If flooding wipes out 70% of your hardware → EF = 0.7

---

## b) Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

“How much money do we lose per incident?”

Formula:  
SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor

Example in the text:

- Asset value = $100,000
    
- EF = 70%
    

→ SLE = 100,000 × 0.7 = $70,000

That's the cost of _one_ disaster.

---

## c) Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

“How often does the event happen per year?”

- Happens once a year → ARO = 1
    
- Happens once every 2 years → ARO = 0.5
    
- Happens once every 10 years → ARO = 0.1
    

It’s simply frequency.

---

## d) Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

“What’s the expected loss per year?”

Formula:  
ALE = SLE × ARO

This is the _most important number_.  
It tells you how much money the risk costs you _annually_.

---

# 3. Example From the Text (Full Breakdown)

A company owns a server:

- Asset value = $10,000
    
- Exposure Factor = 50%
    
- Server fails once every 2 years → ARO = 0.5
    

### Step 1 — Calculate SLE

SLE = $10,000 × 0.5 = $5,000

Each crash costs them $5,000.

### Step 2 — Calculate ARO

“Once every 2 years”  
→ ARO = 1/2 = 0.5

### Step 3 — Calculate ALE

ALE = SLE × ARO = 5,000 × 0.5 = $2,500

So the company loses $2,500 per year, on average, because of server crashes.

---

# 4. Using ALE for Decision-Making

Now that you know the annual loss ($2,500/year), you can evaluate solutions.

### Proposed mitigation:

Buy a new high-redundancy server that only fails once every 10 years.

Meaning:

- New ARO = 0.1
    
- New ALE = _much lower_ (SLE × 0.1)
    

### Savings

Old ALE = $2,500  
New ALE ≈ $500

→ Savings = $2,000 per year

But…

If the new server costs $50,000 (vs current $10,000)  
and lasts only 3 years,

You spend an extra $40,000  
to save $2,000 × 3 = $6,000

Bad investment.

Quantitative analysis prevents stupid decisions.

---

# 5. Summary (Keep This Sharp)

Quantitative Risk = Numerical, objective risk measurement.

Know these four values:

### 1) Exposure Factor (EF)

% of asset lost per incident.

### 2) Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

Loss per incident.  
SLE = Asset Value × EF

### 3) Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

How often the incident happens per year.

### 4) Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

Expected yearly loss.  
ALE = SLE × ARO

---

# 6. Why This Matters

Once you know ALE:

- You compare annual loss vs cost of mitigation.
    
- You avoid buying over-engineered, overpriced solutions.
    
- You justify decisions to management with math, not opinions.
    

This is how professionals talk about risk:  
not with “maybe”, but with numbers that force clarity.

# 📘 Quantitative Risk Analysis — The SOC Story

### _(Richard Feynman Mode ON)_

“Alright kid, listen carefully. This one’s important.”

---

# ⭐ THE STORY: “THE DAY THE BACKUP SERVER DIED”

_(A real-time scenario that happens in companies all the time)_

You’re a fresh SOC Analyst in a medium-sized company.  
One Monday morning, the Network Admin named _Ravi_ is pale like he saw a ghost.

You ask him,  
“What happened?”

Ravi says:

> “The backup server died last night. 40% of last week’s data is gone.”

The CFO storms in:  
“How much money did we lose? Will this happen again?”

Everyone looks around.  
Nobody has an answer.

So the CISO turns to _you_, the new SOC guy, and says:

> “Kid, run a quantitative risk analysis.  
> Tell me EXACTLY how bad this is, and what we should do.”

Now the story really begins.

---

## STEP 1 — Identify the Asset

The backup server stores customer invoices, payroll data, and configuration backups.

Its value? ₹20,00,000 (2 million INR).

You note it down.

---

## STEP 2 — Exposure Factor (EF)

The team estimates:

> “If the backup server crashes, we lose about 40% of our data.”

So EF = 40% = 0.4

This is how much damage the incident causes _each time it happens_.

---

## STEP 3 — Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

You calculate:

`SLE = Asset Value × EF   SLE = 20,00,000 × 0.4 = 8,00,000`

You look up and say:

> “Sir, every time this server crashes, we lose ₹8 lakhs.”

Ravi’s jaw drops.  
The CFO nearly faints.

Now you’ve got everyone’s attention.

---

## STEP 4 — Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

You ask Ravi:

“How often does this happen?”

Ravi:

> “Honestly… around twice a year.”

So ARO = 2

---

## STEP 5 — Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

Now you calculate the big truth:

`ALE = SLE × ARO   ALE = 8,00,000 × 2 = 16,00,000`

You turn to the room:

> “We lose ₹16 lakhs every year because this server keeps failing.”

Suddenly everyone is silent.

The CFO says:  
“Sixteen lakhs? Every year?”

You nod.

This is when quantitative risk analysis becomes REAL.

---

## STEP 6 — Evaluate Mitigation Options

A vendor proposes:

> “We have a fault-tolerant backup solution.  
> Costs ₹10 lakhs upfront, lasts 5 years,  
> and reduces failures from twice a year to once in ten years.”

You quickly run the numbers.

### ⭐ New ARO = 0.1

_(once every 10 years)_

`New ALE = 8,00,000 × 0.1 = 80,000`

Savings per year = ₹16,00,000 – ₹80,000 = ₹15,20,000 per year

Even the CFO says:

> “This is a no-brainer.”

Company approves the new server.

You solved a real business problem using pure math.

---

## STEP 7 — The Outcome

Six months later, the CISO pats your shoulder:

> “Good job, kid.  
> Risk management isn’t magic.  
> It’s about putting numbers on fear so executives can make decisions.”

And from that day, whenever someone in the company talked about “risk”, they said:

> “Ask that SOC kid… he sees numbers in everything.”
