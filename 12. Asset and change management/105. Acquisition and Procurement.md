# Acquisition and Procurement

## Core Definitions

### Acquisition

- Acquisition is the act of obtaining goods or services
    
- It refers to the final step where a product or service is actually purchased or received
    

### Procurement

- Procurement is the end-to-end process that leads to acquisition
    
- Includes:
    
    - Identifying needs
        
    - Sourcing vendors
        
    - Budget approval
        
    - Risk and security review
        
    - Authorization
        
    - Purchasing
        
- Acquisition is a subset of procurement
    

Key distinction:

> Procurement = process  
> Acquisition = outcome

## Why Structured Procurement Is Required

Large organizations do not allow ad-hoc purchases, even if employees have access to funds, because procurement must ensure:

- Budget adherence
    
- Strategic alignment with business goals
    
- Security and compatibility validation
    
- Regulatory and policy compliance
    
- Risk reduction

## Purchase Options Used by Organizations

Organizations typically allow three purchasing methods:

---

## 1. Company Credit Card (Corporate Card)

### Purpose

- Used for low-cost, urgent purchases
    

### Characteristics

- Limited to specific employees
    
- Transaction limits vary by role
    
- Restricted item categories
    

### Typical Use Cases

- Office supplies (ink, toner, paper)
    
- Small operational needs requiring immediate purchase
    

### Controls

- Spending limits
    
- Item restrictions
    
- Post-purchase auditing

## 2. Individual Purchase (Reimbursement Model)

### Definition

- An employee purchases items using personal funds
    
- Organization reimburses the employee afterward
    

### When Used

- Employee does not have a company credit card
    
- Emergency or time-sensitive purchases
    
- Travel expenses (flights, hotels, food, fuel)
    
- Newly formed organizations without corporate credit facilities
    

### Process

1. Employee makes purchase
    
2. Employee submits receipts
    
3. Accounting reimburses via check or direct deposit
    

### Risk Considerations

- Expense fraud risk
    
- Requires strict reimbursement policies

## 3. Purchase Order (PO)

### Definition

- A formal financial authorization document
    
- Issued by the purchasing or finance department
    

### Used For

- High-value purchases
    
- Hardware
    
- Software
    
- Bulk services or licenses
    

### Important Clarification

- A PO is not payment
    
- A PO is a legal commitment to pay
    

### Payment Terms

- Governed by contractual terms such as:
    
    - Net 15
        
    - Net 30
        
    - Net 60
        
- Indicates days allowed to complete payment after invoicing
    

### Contractual Relationship

- PO operates under an existing Master Service Agreement (MSA)

## Internal Approval Process (Pre-Procurement)

Before purchasing hardware or software, organizations typically require approval to ensure:

### 1. Business Justification

- Purchase aligns with organizational goals
    
- Clear operational benefit
    

### 2. Budget Validation

- Funds are allocated and available
    
- Source of funding verified
    

### 3. Security Review

- Product meets security standards
    
- No unacceptable cybersecurity risks
    

### 4. Compatibility Review

- Works with existing infrastructure
    
- Does not disrupt current systems

## Example: U.S. Navy IT Procurement (ITPR)

### ITPR – Information Technology Procurement Request

Before any IT purchase:

1. Need and benefits analysis conducted
    
2. Security evaluation performed
    
3. Interoperability with existing systems verified
    
4. Budget and funding source confirmed
    
5. Multi-level approval by senior leadership
    
6. Formal authorization granted
    

Key takeaway:  
High-security organizations enforce rigorous procurement controls

---

## Post-Approval Procurement Activities

Once approval is granted, additional steps occur:

### 1. Compatibility Testing

- Ensures system integration success
    

### 2. Security Configuration

- Secure installation
    
- Access controls
    
- Hardening
    

### 3. User Training

- Proper usage
    
- Security awareness
    

### 4. Workflow Integration

- Incorporation into operational processes

## Final Summary

- Operational efficiency
