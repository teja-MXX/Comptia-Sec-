# 🧠 ASYMMETRIC ALGORITHMS — FEYNMAN-STYLE NOTES (Technical + Clear)

Asymmetric cryptography = Public Key Cryptography (PKC)  
Core property: Two different keys are involved:

- Public Key — sharable with the whole world
    
- Private Key — kept secret only by the owner
    

These keys are mathematically linked.  
Anything encrypted with _one_ key can be decrypted only with _the other_.

Symmetric = same key for encrypt + decrypt  
Asymmetric = two different keys

# 1. What Asymmetric Crypto Provides (Technical)

Asymmetric algorithms allow 4 security goals:

### ✔ Confidentiality

Encrypt using receiver’s public key → only receiver can decrypt using receiver’s private key.

### ✔ Integrity

A hash (digest) of the message ensures it was not altered.

### ✔ Authentication

Using someone’s public key to verify a signature proves _who_ signed it.

### ✔ Non-repudiation

If a signature is made using _your_ private key,  
→ you cannot deny sending it because only _you_ possess that private key.

# 2. Two Types of Usage (Important!)

## A. Sending a Secret Message (Confidentiality)

If I want to send confidential data to Mary:

1. I encrypt with Mary's public key.
    
2. Only Mary’s private key can decrypt it.
    

Even I, the sender, can't decrypt after encryption because:

- Asymmetric encryption is one-way when using the public key.
    
- Only the paired private key reverses it.
    

## B. Proving the Sender’s Identity (Non-repudiation / Digital Signature)

If I want to prove I sent something:

1. I hash the message → produces a digest.
    
2. I encrypt the digest using my private key → this becomes a digital signature.
    
3. Anyone can verify it:
    
    - They decrypt the signature using my public key.
        
    - If the digest matches the actual message’s hash → message wasn’t changed.

# 3. Combining Both in Real-World Email Security

For secure email:

1. Integrity + Non-repudiation
    
    - Sender creates hash → encrypts hash using sender’s private key → digital signature.
        
2. Confidentiality
    
    - Message itself is encrypted using receiver’s public key.
        

This gives:

- Integrity (digest)
    
- Authentication (signature)
    
- Non-repudiation (private-key-signed hash)
    
- Confidentiality (public-key-encrypted message)

# 4. MAIN ASYMMETRIC ALGORITHMS

We focus on 3 families:

---

# 1️⃣ Diffie–Hellman (DH)

### Purpose: Secure key exchange

DH is NOT used to encrypt big data directly.  
It is used to securely generate a shared symmetric key between two parties over an insecure channel.

Used heavily in:

- VPN setup (IPsec)
    
- TLS key exchange (older forms)
    
- Any time you need to agree on a symmetric secret across the internet
    

### Weakness

DH alone is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) unless combined with:

- Authentication (password/certificate)
    
- Digital signatures
    

### Key point to remember like Feynman

> “Diffie-Hellman = asymmetric method used to safely create a symmetric shared key.”

---

# 2️⃣ RSA

### Purpose:

- Key exchange
    
- Encryption
    
- Digital signatures
    
- Authentication
    

### Security basis:

Difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

### Key sizes:

1024 → 4096 bits.

### Where used:

- TLS/SSL (certificates)
    
- Authentication tokens
    
- Secure emails
    
- Smartcards, MFA devices  
    → Those tokens generating 6-digit numbers every 30–60 secs?  
    Those use RSA one-time keys internally.
    

### Feynman understanding

> “RSA = public key crypto built on prime factorization. Hard to break because splitting giant primes is computationally expensive.”

---

# 3️⃣ ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

### Purpose:

- Encryption
    
- Key exchange
    
- Signatures
    
- Used especially for mobile/low-power devices
    

### Security basis:

Math on elliptic curves over finite fields.  
More efficient than RSA.

### Why it's powerful:

A 256-bit ECC key = ~2048-bit RSA key strength, but using far less computational power.

### Why used in mobiles:

Phones/tablets have weaker CPUs → ECC gives strong security with minimal processing.

---

## 3.1 Variants of ECC

### 📌 ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman)

ECC version of DH → used for key exchange.

### 📌 ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Ephemeral)

Same as ECDH, but uses a new key for each session, giving Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

### 📌 ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

ECC-based digital signatures.  
Used by the US Government.

# 🧠 Final Summary (Pure Technical Feynman Form)

### Symmetric

- Same key for encrypt and decrypt
    
- Fast, used for bulk data
    

### Asymmetric

- Two keys (public + private)
    
- Used for:
    
    - encryption
        
    - digital signatures
        
    - integrity
        
    - authentication
        
    - key exchange
        

### Diffie–Hellman

- Used only for key exchanges

### RSA

- Based on factoring primes
    
- Used for encryption, signatures, MFA tokens
    

### ECC
