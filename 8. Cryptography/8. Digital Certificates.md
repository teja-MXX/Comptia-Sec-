# DIGITAL CERTIFICATES — FEYNMAN NOTES (FULL, TECHNICAL, COMPLETE)

_(Covers every point from the text)_

---

## 1. What is a Digital Certificate?

A digital certificate is a digitally-signed electronic document that binds a public key to an identity.

### A “user” can be:

- A human
    
- A server
    
- A workstation
    
- A device/application
    

### Certificates follow:

- X.509 standard (defines structure → subject info, issuer info, public keys, signatures)
    

### A certificate contains:

- Subject’s name (person/server/organization)
    
- Subject’s public key
    
- Issuer (Certificate Authority) information
    
- Validity period (start/end)
    
- Serial number
    
- CA's digital signature

# KEY TERMS (1 to 14)

You MUST know all these for PKI, TLS, HTTPS, and Security+.

---

# 1️⃣ Wildcard Certificates

Wildcard certificate = One certificate that covers all subdomains under the same root domain.

Example:  
Wildcard for `*.example.com` covers:

- `www.example.com`
    
- `courses.example.com`
    
- `api.example.com`
    

### Pros:

- Cheaper → one certificate covers many subdomains
    
- Easier to manage → only one cert to renew
    
- Widely used in multi-service architectures
    

### Cons:

- If compromised → all subdomains become compromised
    
- Revocation affects all servers
    
- Must reissue and redistribute everywhere
    

---

# 2️⃣ Single-Sided vs Dual-Sided Certificates

### Single-Sided Certificate

- Only the server presents a certificate to the client.
    
- Example: normal HTTPS websites.
    
- Browser verifies server → establishes TLS.
    

### Dual-Sided Certificate (Mutual TLS / mTLS)

- Server verifies client certificate
    
- Client verifies server certificate
    
- Used only in high-security systems
    
- Requires more processing overhead
    

---

# 3️⃣ Self-Signed Certificates

A self-signed certificate is signed by the entity itself, not a CA.

### Properties:

- Provides encryption, but NOT trust
    
- Browsers show warnings
    
- Good for testing / internal use
    
- Bad for public websites (no third-party validation)
    

---

# 4️⃣ Third-Party Certificates

Certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) such as:

- VeriSign
    
- DigiCert
    
- GlobalSign
    
- AWS, Google, Cloudflare CAs
    

### Why trusted?

Operating systems and browsers embed CA root certificates.

This means:  
→ Any certificate issued by those CAs is automatically trusted.

---

# 5️⃣ Root of Trust (Chain of Trust)

A certificate is trusted because:

- It is signed by another trusted certificate (intermediate CA)
    
- Which is signed by another trusted certificate
    
- … leading up to the Root CA
    

### Chain:

`End-entity certificate (your website cert) ⭡ Signed by Intermediate CA ⭡ Signed by Root CA (most trusted)`

If the Root CA is compromised, every certificate below it becomes compromised.

---

# 6️⃣ Certificate Authority (CA)

A Certificate Authority:

- Issues digital certificates
    
- Signs them
    
- Stores public key copies
    
- Maintains certificate revocation lists
    
- Verifies identity before issuing
    

Certificate contains:

- CA name
    
- CA digital signature
    
- Serial number
    
- Validity dates
    
- Version number
    

---

# 7️⃣ Registration Authority (RA)

An RA is like a “front desk” for a CA.

### Responsibilities:

- Accept certificate requests
    
- Verify the user’s identity
    
- Pass validated requests to the CA
    

CA signs the certificate; RA handles user verification.

---

# 8️⃣ Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

A CSR is a block of encoded text generated when requesting a certificate.

### Contains:

- The public key
    
- Organization name
    
- Domain name
    
- Location
    
- Email
    
- Country
    

### Important:

The private key NEVER leaves the requester’s machine.  
CA only receives:

- Public key
    
- Metadata
    

CA validates → signs → returns certificate.

---

# 9️⃣ Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

A CRL is a full list of all revoked certificates issued by a CA.

Reasons for revocation:

- Key compromise
    
- Mis-issuance
    
- Owner leaves company
    
- Malicious activity
    

When your browser requests a certificate:

- CA checks CRL → if certificate is revoked, browser will reject connection.
    

---

# 🔟 OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)

OCSP checks one certificate’s revocation status using its serial number.

### Properties:

- Faster than CRL
    
- Does NOT use encryption → less secure
    
- Returns:
    
    - GOOD
        
    - REVOKED
        
    - UNKNOWN
        

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ OCSP Stapling

Optimization of OCSP.

Instead of the client querying the OCSP server:

- The web server itself periodically fetches its OCSP status
    
- “Staples” (attaches) it to the TLS handshake
    

### Benefits:

- Faster TLS handshake
    
- Less load on the CA
    
- No privacy leak (CA can’t track who visited which site)
    

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Public Key Pinning

Used to prevent certificate impersonation attacks.

### Idea:

Server sends a list of trusted public keys in the HTTP header.

Browser checks:

- “Does the certificate I received match one of the pinned keys?”
    

If NOT:  
→ Browser warns of attack → blocks connection

Note: Public key pinning is deprecated in browsers due to risk of locking out websites if misconfigured.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ Key Escrow Agents

Key escrow = storing a secure backup copy of private keys.

Used when:

- User loses private key
    
- Employee leaves company
    
- Legal access required
    

Handled by key escrow agent (person/system).

Security measures:

- Must protect escrow store
    
- Require two administrators to retrieve keys (separation of duties)
    

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ Key Recovery Agents

These are software systems that recover:

- Lost
    
- Corrupted
    
- Destroyed
    

keys.

Used for disaster recovery of CA keys.

If the CA is destroyed (fire, ransomware, etc.), the key recovery agent can restore keys.

---

# FULL SUMMARY — Digital Certificate System

### Digital Certificates provide:

- Authentication
    
- Encryption
    
- Integrity
    
- Non-repudiation
    

### Everything depends on:

✔ Trust in the Certificate Authorities  
✔ Correct chain of trust  
✔ Protection of private keys  
✔ Proper revocation checking  
✔ Strong policies around issuance

If Root CA is compromised → entire PKI collapses.

If wildcard certificate is compromised → all subdomains compromised.

If private key is lost → escrow or recovery agent required.
