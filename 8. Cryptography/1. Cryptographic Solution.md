# 📘 FEYNMAN NOTES — CRYPTOGRAPHY FUNDAMENTALS (Domain 1 & 2)

## 1. What is Cryptography?

Cryptography = the science of writing codes + solving codes so the real meaning is hidden.  
Modern cryptography mainly = encryption.

### Encryption

- Converts plaintext → ciphertext (unreadable).
    
- Only someone with the correct key can turn ciphertext back → plaintext.
    

Encryption protects data in all 3 states:

- Data at rest (stored on HDD/SSD).
    
- Data in transit (moving over network or memory bus).
    
- Data in use (being processed inside CPU).

# 2. 3 States of Data

### Data at Rest

- Inactive, stored on disk.
    
- Needs full-disk encryption or file-level encryption.
    

### Data in Transit

- Moving over a network, or moving between RAM ↔ CPU ↔ storage.
    
- Needs protocols like TLS, SSH, IPsec.
    

### Data in Use

- Currently being processed or modified by CPU.
    
- Hardest to protect; usually protected via secure enclaves, memory encryption.

# 3. Basic Encryption Example: ROT13

ROT13 is a cipher (algorithm).  
Key = 13 (rotate letters by 13 positions).

Important point:  
➡ Security does NOT come from the algorithm — it comes from the key.

Modern algorithms are:

- public
    
- peer-reviewed
    
- strength = key secrecy + key length
    

---

# 4. What is a Cipher/Algorithm?

A cipher = mathematical function that transforms data.  
Input → (math operation) → output.

ROT13 example:

- Input: C
    
- Apply algorithm: rotate 13 letters
    
- Output: P
    

All encryption works like this but MUCH more complex than ROT13.

---

# 5. Importance of Keys

Encryption strength = key length, not the algorithm.

📌 Key length ∝ exponential security  
Example:

- 128-bit key → strong
    
- 256-bit key → exponentially stronger (NOT double, but squared effect)
    

### Key Rotation

Keys must be:

- long
    
- secret
    
- rotated regularly
    

Why?

- Long exposure = risk of guessing/bruteforce
    
- Technology improves (faster cracking)
    

Typical rotations:

- TLS certificates → yearly
    
- Cloud KMS systems → ~90 days (automatic)
    

---

# 6. Algorithms Are Public

Very important idea:

- Algorithms are NOT SECRET.
    
- They are public & open source.
    
- Security = secrecy of the key, NOT obscurity (security-through-obscurity = bad).
    

Keys must be:

- stored in secure modules (HSMs, TPMs)
    
- encrypted when stored
    
- transmitted securely
    
- access tightly restricted
    
- audited regularly
    

If the key is exposed → the entire system collapses.

# ✔ Summary of the Entire Transcript in Feynman Form

Cryptography is the science of hiding information using mathematical algorithms. It protects data in all states (rest, transit, use). All encryption works using two components: an algorithm (public) and a key (secret), and security always depends on the key. Strong keys must be long, rotated often, and protected carefully.

The course will examine symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, hashing, PKI, digital certificates, blockchain, encryption hardware modules, obfuscation techniques, and cryptographic attacks (downgrade, collisions, birthday, quantum). The goal is to understand how cryptography works, why key security matters, how algorithms are used, and how attackers try to break them.
