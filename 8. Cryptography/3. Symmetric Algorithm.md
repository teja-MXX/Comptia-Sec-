# 🧠 Symmetric Encryption Algorithms — Feynman-Style Technical Notes

## 1. What is Symmetric Encryption?

- One key for both encryption and decryption.
    
- Sender and receiver must share the same secret key.
    
- Because both sides use the same key, symmetric encryption is:
    
    - Fast (100–1000× faster than asymmetric)
        
    - But has a big problem: key distribution  
        → How do you securely give the same key to all parties?

# 🧩 The Symmetric Algorithms You Must Know

We cover DES, 3DES, IDEA, AES, Blowfish, Twofish, and the RC (Rivest Cipher) family.

---

# 2. DES (Data Encryption Standard)

### Essentials

- Cipher type: Symmetric Block Cipher
    
- Block size: 64 bits
    
- Key length: 64-bit key, but 8 bits are parity, so effective key = 56 bits.
    
- Rounds: 16 rounds of substitution + permutation.
    

### Why DES became obsolete

- 56 bits is too small → brute force can crack it easily with modern hardware.
    
- Strong in the 70s; weak after the 2000s.
    

---

# 3. 3DES (Triple DES)

### Why it was created

DES became weak → 3DES extends it by applying DES three times with three different 56-bit keys.

### How it works

Process:

1. Encrypt with Key1
    
2. Decrypt with Key2
    
3. Encrypt with Key3
    

This gives ~112 bits of effective security (not full 168 because of meet-in-the-middle attacks).

### Why it's dying out

- Slow (DES × 3)
    
- Still not strong enough long-term
    
- Being replaced by AES.
    

---

# 4. IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)

### Essentials

- Cipher type: Symmetric Block Cipher
    
- Block size: 64 bits
    
- Key length: 128 bits
    

### Usage

- Popular in PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) tools.
    

### Why not mainstream

- Secure but overshadowed by AES (government-standard).
    

---

# 5. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

This is the king of symmetric encryption today.

### Essentials

- Cipher type: Symmetric Block Cipher
    
- Block size: 128 bits
    
- Key sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits
    
- Originally called Rijndael (the contest winner; AES is the standardized version).
    

### Why AES is standard

- Strong
    
- Fast
    
- Efficient in hardware and software
    
- Adopted by NIST to replace DES/3DES
    
- Used by US Gov for “Sensitive but Unclassified” data.
    

### What you MUST remember

AES = strongest, fastest, most commonly used symmetric algorithm.

---

# 6. Blowfish

### Essentials

- Cipher type: Symmetric Block Cipher
    
- Block size: 64 bits
    
- Key size: 32 to 448 bits
    
- Open-source, unpatented.
    

### Why it was created

Replacement for DES.

### Why it didn’t become standard

Good but AES won the NIST competition.

---

# 7. Twofish

### Essentials

- Cipher type: Symmetric Block Cipher
    
- Block size: 128 bits
    
- Key sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits
    
- Also open-source and unpatented.
    

### Notes

- Was a finalist in the AES competition.
    
- Very secure, but AES ultimately won.
    

---

# 8. Rivest Cipher (RC) Family

Created by Ron Rivest, co-creator of RSA.

### Quick summary of RC versions

- RC1 – never published
    
- RC2 – weak
    
- RC3 – broken before release
    
- RC4 – widely used (stream cipher)
    
- RC5 – block cipher, variable rounds/key
    
- RC6 – stronger version of RC5, submitted to AES contest
    

Now the ones that matter:

---

## RC4

### Essentials

- Stream cipher (the only stream cipher in this lesson)
    
- Key size: 40 to 2048 bits
    

### Where it was used

- SSL/TLS
    
- WEP (Wi-Fi)
    

### Status

- Now considered insecure due to bias vulnerabilities.
    

---

## RC5

### Essentials

- Block cipher
    
- Variable block size (32/64/128 bits)
    
- Key sizes up to 2048 bits
    

---

## RC6

### Essentials

- Improvement over RC5
    
- Submitted to AES competition
    
- Lost to Rijndael (AES)

# 🧩 What to Remember for Exams & Interviews

### 1. AES is the most used and strongest symmetric cipher today.

### 2. All algorithms in this lesson are symmetric EXCEPT none

(Everything here is symmetric.)

### 3. Only one is a stream cipher:

→ RC4

### 4. DES is weak, 3DES is legacy, AES is modern.

### 5. Key sizes matter: bigger key → stronger encryption.

### 6. Most modern systems use a hybrid model:

Asymmetric (RSA/ECC) to share the symmetric key → then use AES for bulk data.
