# 🔐 PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) — FEYNMAN TECHNICAL NOTES

## 1. What is PKI?

PKI = Public Key Infrastructure  
PKI is not just encryption. It is an entire framework made of:

- Hardware
    
- Software
    
- Policies
    
- Procedures
    
- People
    

Its purpose:  
👉 Create, manage, distribute, store, and revoke asymmetric key pairs and digital certificates.

If you’ve ever used HTTPS, you’ve used PKI.

# 🔑 2. How HTTPS Works (Technical Flow)

### Step 1 — You type:

`https://www.diontraining.com`

### Step 2 — Browser obtains the website’s public key

Your browser checks with a Certificate Authority (CA):  
“Give me the certificate of this web server.”

The certificate contains:

- Web server’s public key
    
- Domain name
    
- Issuer (CA)
    
- Validity dates
    
- Signature from CA
    

This is how trust begins.

---

# 🔑 3. Creating the Secure Session Key

Your browser generates a random symmetric session key.  
Example used in text: `51363` (real keys are long, e.g., 256 bits)

This symmetric key will be used for bulk encryption using AES inside TLS.

But first you must deliver this key securely to the server.

---

# 🔐 4. Asymmetric Encryption Step

- Your browser encrypts the random session key (`51363`) using the server’s public key.
    
- Only the server’s private key can decrypt it.
    

This ensures:

- No one on the internet can read the session key.
    
- Only the real server (who has the private key) can decrypt it → authentication.
    

### Server decrypts it

- Server receives ciphertext.
    
- Uses its private key.
    
- Recovers the session key `51363`.
    

Now both sides know the same shared key.

This entire part = Asymmetric encryption (RSA/ECC).

---

# ⚡ 5. Switching to Symmetric Encryption (TLS Tunnel)

After the key exchange:

- Browser and server create a TLS/SSL tunnel.
    
- Symmetric algorithm (like AES) encrypts all data.
    

Benefits:

- Confidentiality → only you and server can read traffic.
    
- Authentication → server proved it owns private key.
    
- Integrity → TLS ensures data is not altered.
    

You now see the padlock (🔒) in the browser.

# 📌 Public Key Cryptography vs PKI

These are NOT the same thing.

### Public Key Cryptography

Just the math:

- Key generation
    
- Encryption
    
- Decryption
    
- RSA/ECC algorithms
    

### PKI

A full system that:

- Creates key pairs
    
- Issues certificates
    
- Validates certificates
    
- Revokes certificates
    
- Maintains trust
    
- Manages policies
    
- Maintains CA hierarchy
    

So PKI = _public key crypto + trust + management + infrastructure_.

---

# 🏛️ Certificate Authority (CA)

CA = trusted third party that:

- Issues digital certificates
    
- Validates identities
    
- Signs certificates
    
- Maintains a global trust network
    

Your browser trusts CAs that are preloaded in the OS (root store).

---

# 🗃️ KEY ESCROW (Very Important in PKI)

Key escrow =  
A secure third-party storage location for private keys or encryption keys.

Used when:

- User loses their private key
    
- Employee leaves the company
    
- Legal investigations require access
    
- Encrypted corporate data must be recovered
    

### Example scenario from the text

Employee encrypts files with their personal PKI certificate.  
Employee leaves. Company cannot decrypt.  
→ Key escrow allows the organization to recover the key and decrypt data.

### Security Risks

- If escrow storage is compromised → massive data compromise
    
- Must be:
    
    - highly secured
        
    - tightly access-controlled
        
    - audited
        

Escrow = convenience + danger.

# 🏗️ PKI – The Full Purpose

PKI provides:

- Secure data transfer
    
- Authentication of servers and users
    
- Encrypted communications
    
- Digital signatures
    
- Certificate lifecycle management
    
- Recovery mechanisms via key escrow
    

PKI ensures end-to-end secure communication and identity verification on the internet.

# 🔎 PKI vs Public Key Encryption — Final Clarification

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Public Key Encryption|Only the encryption/decryption using key pairs. One small part.|
|PKI|Includes keys, certificates, CAs, policies, revocation, trust hierarchy, software, hardware, people. Complete system.|

# 🎯 FEYNMAN SUMMARY

- HTTPS uses asymmetric encryption to safely exchange a symmetric key.
    
- That symmetric key creates the TLS tunnel.
    
- PKI is the entire system that manages these keys and certificates.
    
- Certificate Authorities are the root of trust.
    
- Key Escrow stores private keys securely for recovery.
    
- PKI enables secure communication, identity verification, and encrypted data exchange across networks.
