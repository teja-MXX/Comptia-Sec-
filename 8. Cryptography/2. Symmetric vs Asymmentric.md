# 📘 FEYNMAN NOTES — SYMMETRIC vs ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION (Stream & Block Ciphers)

## 1. Two Big Families of Encryption

Every encryption method fits into one of two categories:

### A. Symmetric Encryption

- ONE key  
    Same key encrypts and decrypts.
    
- Also called private key encryption.
    
- Sender and receiver must both hold the same key.
    

Think:  
Everyone who wants to open the same locked door must have the same physical key.

### B. Asymmetric Encryption

- TWO keys
    
    - Public key → encrypt
        
    - Private key → decrypt
        
- Also called public key cryptography.
    
- You never share your private key.
    

Think:  
A special lock with two keys — one everyone can use to lock (public key) and only you can use to unlock (private key).

# 2. Symmetric Encryption — What It Really Means

### How it works

One shared secret key → used on both sides.

### Benefits

- Extremely fast  
    (100–1000× faster than asymmetric)
    
- Perfect for encrypting large data  
    (files, video streams, network traffic)
    

### Problems

#### A. Key Distribution Problem

How do we _secretly_ give the same key to all people who need it?

Example:  
You want to share encrypted messages with 5 friends.

You need:

- A separate unique symmetric key for every pair of people.
    

# pairs between 6 people → 15 keys

This doesn’t scale.  
Imagine 100 employees → 4950 keys.

#### B. No Non-Repudiation

If all 5 friends share the same key:

- Someone deletes a file ✓
    
- Someone reads your data ✓
    

But you can’t prove which person did it.

Because all of them used the same key.

#### C. Loss of Confidentiality at Large Scale

Example: Wi-Fi at a party.

You give your Wi-Fi password (shared secret) to 50 people.

Now:

- All 50 can see your traffic
    
- Anyone can misuse the network
    
- Anyone can attack other devices
    

Shared secrets do not scale safely.

# 3. Asymmetric Encryption — Solves Symmetric Problems

Instead of one shared secret, you have:

### Two Keys

1. Public Key
    
    - Can be given to anyone
        
    - Used ONLY to encrypt
        
2. Private Key
    
    - Must be kept secret
        
    - Used ONLY to decrypt
        

Your public key is like your WhatsApp number — anyone can contact you.  
Your private key is your phone's unlock code — only you know it.

### Benefits

- No key distribution problem  
    (everyone gets your public key)
    
- Enables digital signatures
    
- Enables non-repudiation  
    (private key proves _you_ did something)
    

### Downsides

- Very slow
    
- Bad for encrypting large data
    
- Used only for:
    
    - secure key exchange
        
    - authentication
        
    - digital signatures
        

### Common Asymmetric Algorithms

- RSA
    
- Diffie-Hellman
    
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

# 4. HYBRID Encryption — Best of Both Worlds

Modern systems never use “only symmetric” or “only asymmetric.”

They do this:

1. Use asymmetric encryption  
    → to securely share a random symmetric key
    
2. Use symmetric encryption  
    → to encrypt the actual data (because it’s faster)
    

This is what HTTPS/TLS does every second on the internet.

Asymmetric fixes the key-sharing problem.  
Symmetric gives blazing-fast encryption.

# 5. Stream vs Block Ciphers

These describe _how_ data is fed into the symmetric algorithm.

---

## A. Stream Cipher

- Encrypts bit by bit or byte by byte
    
- Uses a keystream generator
    
- Then XORs plaintext with the keystream  
    (XOR = simple math operation used in crypto)
    

### Good for

- Real-time data
    
    - audio streams
        
    - video streams
        
    - VoIP calls
        

### Characteristics

- Usually symmetric
    
- Usually used in hardware
    
- Efficient for continuous data flow
    

---

## B. Block Cipher

- Encrypts fixed-size chunks (blocks)
    
- Common block sizes:  
    64-bit, 128-bit, 256-bit
    
- If data isn’t enough to fill the block → add padding
    

Example:  
1 KB message → split into 16 blocks of 64 bytes  
Each block goes through the algorithm and becomes ciphertext block.

### Advantages

- Easier to implement
    
- Fewer vulnerabilities
    
- Works well in software
    
- Commonly used in:
    
    - file encryption
        
    - disk encryption
        
    - secure protocols (TLS uses block ciphers)
