# Cryptographic Attacks – Clean, Structured Lesson Notes

Cryptographic attacks refer to techniques used by adversaries to defeat encryption systems and break confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity. Attackers may try to:

- Decrypt data without the key
    
- Forge signatures
    
- Impersonate users
    
- Exploit weaknesses in algorithms or old protocol versions
    
- Break implementations (software bugs)
    
- Brute-force keys
    

In this lesson, we focus on:

1. Downgrade Attacks
    
2. Collision Attacks
    
3. Quantum Computing Threats & Post-Quantum Cryptography

# 1. Downgrade Attacks (Version Rollback Attacks)

A downgrade attack forces two systems to use an older, weaker cryptographic protocol, even though both systems support stronger ones.

### How a Secure Handshake Normally Works

Two systems (Alice & Bob) exchange a list of supported protocol versions → they pick the strongest common version.

Example:

- Alice supports TLS 1.3, 1.2
    
- Bob supports TLS 1.2, 1.1  
    → They choose TLS 1.2
    

### How the Attack Works

Attacker Eve intercepts messages and manipulates them so both sides believe the highest version they both support is an old one (e.g., SSL 3.0).  
→ Alice & Bob unknowingly operate in a weak mode with known vulnerabilities.

### Real-World Example – POODLE Attack

- POODLE = Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption
    
- Forced clients and servers to revert to SSL 3.0, a broken protocol.
    
- Enabled attackers to extract session data from encrypted traffic.
    

### Why Downgrade Attacks Are Dangerous

- They weaponize backward compatibility.
    
- Systems that keep old protocols “just in case” become exploitable.
    

### Defenses

- Drop insecure protocols entirely (disable SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1)
    
- Use version-intolerance checks
    
- Enforce strict TLS configurations

# 2. Collision Attacks

A collision attack aims to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.  
This breaks integrity because hashing is used to verify files, signatures, certificates, etc.

### Why Hash Collisions Matter

A malicious file can be crafted to have the same hash as a legitimate file → users think it’s authentic.

### Example: MD5 Collisions

- MD5 was considered secure in the 1990s/early 2000s.
    
- Researchers later generated distinct inputs with identical MD5 hashes.
    
- MD5 is now banned for certificates, digital signatures, and integrity checks.

## The Birthday Paradox & Collision Attacks

The birthday paradox says that in a group of 23 people, there’s a >50% chance two share the same birthday.

Applied to cryptography:

- Hash collisions are more likely than you intuitively expect.
    
- For an n-bit hash, collisions become feasible at 2^(n/2) attempts.
    

Examples:

- 128-bit hash → theoretical collision at 2^64 operations
    
- 256-bit hash → theoretical collision at 2^128 operations (much harder)
    

This is why SHA-1 and MD5 are broken, but SHA-256 and SHA-3 remain secure today.

# 3. Quantum Computing Threats

Quantum computers use qubits, which can represent multiple states at once using superposition.  
This allows quantum machines to solve some math problems _exponentially faster_ than classical computers.

### Why this matters to cryptography

Current public-key cryptography (RSA, ECC) depends on:

- Factoring large numbers (RSA)
    
- Discrete logarithms (ECC)
    

These are extremely hard for classical computers but easy for quantum systems using Shor’s Algorithm.

### Current Status of Quantum Computers

- No full-scale, practical quantum computer exists yet.
    
- Small prototypes exist (IBM, Google, governments).
    
- Predictions:
    
    - Government/enterprise usable machines: ~2030
        
    - Consumer-level advancements: ~late 2030s–2040s
        

### Which Algorithms Will Break?

Quantum computers can break:

✔ RSA  
✔ ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)  
✔ Diffie–Hellman  
✔ ECDH, ECDSA

But symmetric crypto (AES) and hashing (SHA-2, SHA-3) mostly remain safe if key sizes are increased.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Goal: Create cryptographic algorithms secure against quantum attacks, but runnable on classical computers.

Two strategies:

---

## Strategy 1 — Increase Key Sizes (Symmetric Algorithms)

Example:

- AES-128 → AES-256  
    Doubling the key size squares the complexity for quantum brute-force attacks.
    

---

## Strategy 2 — Use Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

NIST’s 2022 PQC competition selected 4 major winners:

---

### ⭐ Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithm

- CRYSTALS-Kyber
    
    - Lattice-based
        
    - Small keys
        
    - Equivalent to AES-256 strength
        

---

### ⭐ Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms

NIST recommends:

1. CRYSTALS-Dilithium (primary)
    
2. Falcon
    
3. SPHINCS+ (hash-based)
