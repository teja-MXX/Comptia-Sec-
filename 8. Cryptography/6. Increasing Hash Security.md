# ✅ How to Increase Hash Security — Explained Super Simple

To protect passwords and prevent attackers from abusing hashes, you must understand two attacks first:

---

# 🔥 1. Attacks Against Hashing

## (A) Pass-the-Hash Attack

- Windows stores your password hash in memory (LSASS).
    
- If an attacker steals that hash, they don’t need your real password.
    
- They can authenticate just by presenting the hash.
    
- Windows will treat it exactly like the correct password.
    

👉 Why it works:  
Because Windows uses the hash itself as the “proof of password”.

👉 How attackers do it:  
Tools like Mimikatz extract these hashes.

👉 Defenses:

- Latest Windows versions
    
- Credential Guard
    
- Patch everything
    
- Remove local admin rights
    
- MFA
    
- Least privilege
    
- No shared admin accounts
    
- Don’t log in to low-trust systems using privileged accounts

## (B) Birthday Attack (Collision Attack)

- Hash functions can sometimes produce the same digest for different inputs.
    
- This is called a collision.
    
- Attackers try to create two different inputs that generate the same hash.
    

👉 If two passwords produce the same hash, an attacker can bypass authentication.

👉 Why MD5/SHA1 are bad:  
Short output → more chances of collisions → easier collisions → easier birthday attacks.

---

# 🚀 Now — How Do You Increase Hash Security?

There are four main defenses:

---

# 1️⃣ Use LONG, Modern Hashes (SHA-256, SHA-3, Bcrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2)

Longer hash = larger output space = harder to find two inputs with same output.

- MD5: 128 bits → weak
    
- SHA1: 160 bits → weak
    
- SHA-256/SHA-512: strong
    
- SHA-3: even stronger
    
- Argon2, Bcrypt, PBKDF2: strongest for password storage
    

👉 Rule:  
Use SHA-256 or better. For passwords → never use plain SHA. Use slow hashing algorithms (Argon2, Bcrypt, PBKDF2).

---

# 2️⃣ Key Stretching (Repeat the Hash Many Times)

Key stretching = hashing the password thousands of times.

Examples:

- PBKDF2
    
- Bcrypt
    
- Scrypt
    
- Argon2
    

👉 Why it works:  
If hashing once takes 1 millisecond, hashing it 100,000 times takes 100,000 milliseconds.

This makes:

- brute force attacks extremely slow
    
- guessing attacks expensive
    
- GPU attacks much harder
    

Attackers can attempt fewer guesses per second → passwords become much harder to crack.

---

# 3️⃣ Salting (Add Random Data Before Hashing)

Salt = random text added to the password before hashing.

`hash = SHA256(password + random_salt)`

👉 Why salt is critical:

- Even if two users have the same password → hashes become different.
    
- Attackers cannot use rainbow tables.
    
- Attackers must brute force each hash separately.
    
- Forces attackers to do more work.
    

👉 Salts must be:

- random
    
- unique per password
    
- stored alongside the hash (not secret)
    

---

# 4️⃣ Use Nonces (To Stop Replay Attacks)

Nonce = “number used once”.

Nonces make sure every authentication event produces a unique hash, even if:

- password is same
    
- salt is same
    

👉 Why:  
Attackers cannot capture and replay the authentication request.  
Even if they capture the data once, they cannot reuse it again.

---

# 5️⃣ Limit Incorrect Login Attempts

This blocks automated guessing.

- Allow only 3–5 incorrect attempts before locking the account.
    
- This kills:
    
    - brute force
        
    - dictionary attacks
        
    - online guessing
        

👉 Yes, this annoys users.  
👉 But it kills attackers.

# 🔐 SUMMARY (Super Simple)

|Security Feature|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Long Hashes (SHA-256+)|Reduce collisions & birthday attacks|
|Key Stretching (PBKDF2/Bcrypt/Argon2)|Make hashing slow → expensive to brute force|
|Salts|Make each hash unique → defeat rainbow tables|
|Nonces|Stop replay attacks|
|Lockout Policies|Stop repeated password guessing|
|MFA|Stops pass-the-hash from being enough|
|Patching + Least Privilege|Prevent attackers from stealing hashes|

# 🧠 FINAL FFEYNMAN-LEVEL TL;DR

- Hashes can be reused → protect them (pass-the-hash).
    
- Hashes can collide → use long ones (birthday attack).
    
- Strengthen hashes using:
    
    - salts (uniqueness)
        
    - key stretching (slowness)
        
    - nonces (freshness)
        
    - lockouts (limits brute force)
