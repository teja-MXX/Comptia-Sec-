# ⭐ What Are We Actually Looking At?

When you visit **[https://google.com](https://google.com)** or **[https://apple.com](https://apple.com)**, your browser does two things:

1. **Checks whether the website is really Google/Apple**
    
2. **Builds an encrypted tunnel** so no one can spy on the data.
    

To do this, it uses a **digital certificate** (public-key certificate).

When you click the lock icon, you see the certificate details.

# ⭐ Google vs Apple Certificate Comparison

You were shown two certificates:

- **Left: Google**
    
- **Right: Apple**
    

They both use HTTPS but the type of public key used is different.

---

# 🔍 1. Who Is the Certificate For?

Every certificate shows _who it belongs to_:

### **Google**

- Subject (To whom?): **Google LLC**
    
- Location: Mountain View, California
    
- Issued by: **Google Trust Services** (Google’s own CA)
    

### **Apple**

- Subject: **Apple Inc**
    
- Location: Cupertino, California
    
- Issued by: **DigiCert** (a third-party trusted CA)
    

Both certificates were issued by authorities that your browser already trusts.

# 🔍 2. Encryption Algorithm Used

This is the most important difference.

### **Google → ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**

- Key size: **256 bits**
    
- Very small key, very fast
    
- Equally secure as RSA-2048
    

### **Apple → RSA**

- Key size: **2048 bits**
    
- Older and widely supported
    
- Much heavier computationally

# ⭐ Why do they use different algorithms?

### **ECC (Google)**

Google prioritizes speed and performance because:

- billions of mobile users
    
- low-power phones and tablets
    
- ECC = strong security + smaller keys + lower CPU cost  
    (ECC-256 ≈ security of RSA-3072)
    

### **RSA (Apple)**

Apple’s desktop site knows you are on a powerful device:

- more CPU available
    
- RSA is still extremely common
    
- high compatibility with all devices and software
    

**Both algorithms give strong security. They’re just different tools.**

# 🔍 3. What Else Does a Certificate Contain?

Every certificate includes:

### **✔ Validity Period**

- "Valid from"
    
- "Valid to"
    

### **✔ Public Key**

The part that everyone can see.

### **✔ Signature Algorithm**

Example: SHA-256  
Used to verify the certificate wasn’t tampered with.

### **✔ Issuer**

The certificate authority (CA).

### **✔ Unique Fingerprint**

Like a digital DNA for that certificate.

### **✔ Certification Path**

Shows the trust chain (root → intermediate → website).

# ⭐ Why does the certificate matter?

Because this is the ONLY way your browser knows:

- This website is not fake
    
- You are really talking to Google/Apple
    
- No one is intercepting your data
    
- The encryption is safe
    

Without the certificate:

- You could be connecting to a phishing page
    
- Anyone on public Wi-Fi could spy on you
    
- Encryption would not work properly
    
- Browser would show a big RED warning

# ⭐ Feynman Summary

**A digital certificate is like a passport for a website.**

- The **website** is the person.
    
- The **certificate authority** is the government that issues the passport.
    
- Your **browser** checks the passport to verify identity.
    
- Inside the passport is the website’s **public key**.
    
- That key is used to set up a **secure encrypted tunnel**.
    

Google uses a lightweight “sportscar engine” (ECC).  
Apple uses a heavy but reliable “truck engine” (RSA).  
Both get the job done safely.
