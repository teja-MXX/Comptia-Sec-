# ⭐ **1. Authority — “Because the Teacher Said So”**

Kids obey teachers because they sound important.  
Bad guys know this.

So they pretend to be:

- your boss
- the police
- IT admin
- bank manager
    
They say things like:

> “Do this NOW. I’m from IT.”  
> “Approve this. The CEO needs it.”

Your brain says:  
“Oh! This person is powerful. I should obey.”

That’s how they trap you.

# ⭐ **2. Intimidation — “The Bully Threats You”**

Imagine a bully telling you:

> “Give me your lunch or I’ll complain to the principal.”

Scary, right?

Bad guys do the same:

> “Your account will be deleted!”  
> “If you don’t respond, you’ll be fined!”  
> “We will shut your service!”

You panic → you obey.

# ⭐ **3. Consensus (Social Proof) — “Everyone is Doing It!”**

If 20 kids run to the ice-cream man, you run too.  
Human nature.

Attackers use that:

> “All employees have updated their details. You are the only one left!”  
> “Other customers already verified their cards.”

Your brain says:  
“If others did it, must be safe.”

Nope — trap.

# ⭐ **4. Urgency — “Quick! The Last Chocolate Is Going!”**

If someone tells you:

> “Hurry, last piece! Last chance!”

You stop thinking and start acting.

Bad guys LOVE urgency:

> “Update password in 10 minutes!”  
> “Last chance to avoid penalty!”  
> “Transaction alert: approve NOW!”

Your brain switches off logic.  
Attackers switch on victory.

# ⭐ **5. Scarcity — “Limited Edition Toy!”**

If something is rare, you want it more.

So attackers say:

> “Only 100 crypto spots left!”  
> “Limited offer!”  
> “Exclusive access!”

Your brain says:  
“Don’t miss out!”

And then you fall for it.

# ⭐ **6. Familiarity (Trust) — “Your Friend Calling Your Name”**

If your friend calls you, you don’t doubt them.  
Attackers love pretending to be:

- coworkers
- friends
- relatives
- known brands
- your bank
    
Because once you _recognize_ the name, you stop being careful.

They use:

> “Hey bro, can you check this file?”  
> “Mom, I lost my phone, this is my new number.”

And you trust.  
And then you get trapped.


# ⭐ **THE FEYNMAN SUMMARY YOU MUST REMEMBER FOR SECURITY+**

Bad guys press 6 buttons in your brain:

1. **Authority** — “Do it because I’m important.”
2. **Intimidation** — “Do it or face trouble.”
3. **Consensus** — “Others already did it.”
4. **Urgency** — “Do it fast, no time.”
5. **Scarcity** — “Do it before it’s gone.”
6. **Familiarity** — “Do it because you know me.”
    

If ANYONE:

- rushes you,
- scares you,
- pressures you,
- pretends to be powerful,
- pretends to be everyone,
- or pretends to be someone you trust…
    
**Your brain is being hacked.**
