# 🌟 **What Is Pretexting? (Feynman Style)**

Think of pretexting like this:

A magician doesn’t just pull a rabbit out of a hat.  
He _sets up a whole story_ first:

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is a _special magic hat_, passed down from my great-grandfather…”

He builds a **background story** so your brain believes the trick even before it happens.
Bad guys on the internet do the _exact same thing_.  
They create a **fake story** — a _pretext_ — to make you trust them.

### ▶️ **Pretexting = Building a believable story so the victim trusts you.**

It's not just impersonation.  
It’s **story-based impersonation**.

In impersonation, they pretend to be a person.  
In **pretexting**, they create a _full situation_ that feels real.


# 👦 **Kid Example**

Suppose I walk up to you and say:

> “Hey, your father asked me to pick you up from school today. His bike broke down. He asked me to take you home.”

Now I’m not just pretending to be someone.  
I’m giving you **context + story + reason**.

That’s the pretext.

And if it’s believable… your brain says,  
“Yeah… that could be true.”


# 💻 **Cybersecurity Example**

A hacker calls an employee:

> “Hi, I’m Rakesh from IT. We’re running security upgrades today.  
> I need your login to prevent your account from being locked.”

See the pretext?
- A believable scenario (security upgrade)
- A role (IT tech)
- A reason (prevent lockout)
- A sense of urgency
