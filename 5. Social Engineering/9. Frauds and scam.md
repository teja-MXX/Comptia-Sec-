# 🌐 **What Are Frauds, Scams, and Thefts? (Feynman Style)**

Imagine three naughty boys in a school:  
**Freddy Fraud**, **Sammy Scam**, and **Tommy Theft**.

They each do bad things,  
but in _different ways_.

## 🎩 **1. Fraud**

Fraud is **lying in a clever, planned way to get something valuable**.
It’s like Freddy Fraud pretending to be the teacher saying:

> “The principal told me to collect everyone’s lunch money.”

He creates a **fake story**, deceives people, and benefits from the lie.
Fraud = _Deception + Planning + Benefit_.


## 🎭 **2. Scam**

A scam is a **fraud meant to trick MANY people**, usually quickly.
Sammy Scam stands at the school gate shouting:

> “Buy this magic pencil! It gives 100 marks!”

He fools as many students as possible in the shortest time.
Scam = _Fraud for many victims_.


## 🏃 **3. Theft**

Theft is **simply taking something without permission**.
Tommy Theft sneaks into your bag and steals your lunch box.  
No lying, no tricks — just stealing.

Theft = _taking without permission_.


# 🆔 **Identity Fraud vs Identity Theft (Feynman Style)**

Let’s take this slowly.

### 🟦 **Identity Theft = STEALING someone’s personal information.**

It’s the act of collecting:

- your Aadhaar number    
- your PAN
- your bank card
- your email/password
- your address
    
Identity theft = **stealing the identity data**.

### 🟨 **Identity Fraud = USING that stolen identity to commit fraud.**

It’s the act of _using_ your identity to:

- open a bank account
- apply for loans
- transfer money
- pretend to be you
- buy things in your name
    
Identity fraud = **using the stolen identity to commit crimes**.

### 🎯 **EXAM MEMORY TRICK:**

- Identity Theft → _“taking the keys”_    
- Identity Fraud → _“driving the car with those keys”_
    

# 🧾 **What Is an Invoice Scam?**

Imagine your school’s principal pays a shop every month for notebooks.  
Now imagine a bad guy sends a fake invoice:

> “Pay ₹20,000 to this new bank account for this month’s notebooks.”

The principal thinks it's real and sends the money.
This is an **Invoice Scam**.

### ✔ How it works in companies:

Attackers:
- study the company
- learn which vendors supply what
- create a fake invoice (PDF or email)
- send it from a similar-looking email
- force the company to pay to a **fake bank account**
    
Boom — money stolen.

### 🟧 **Why it’s dangerous:**

Because invoices look very normal.  
Companies pay hundreds every month.  
One fake invoice can slip through easily.

### 🟢 **Exam Tip:**

Invoice scam = **social engineering + fake billing + money diversion**.
