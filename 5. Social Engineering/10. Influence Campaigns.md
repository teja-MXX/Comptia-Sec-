# 🎭 **What Is an Influence Campaign? (Feynman Style)**

Imagine someone standing in the middle of a school playground shouting a message:

> “The exam is cancelled!  
> Everyone go home!”

He didn’t ask the teacher.  
He didn’t check anything.  
He just wants everyone to **believe** what benefits _him_.

An **influence campaign** is this idea **scaled to millions of people**.

It is when a group (or a country, or hackers) tries to **shape what large groups of people think, feel, or do** by spreading carefully crafted information.

### Influence Campaign =

**Manipulating people’s beliefs at scale using information.**

They can influence:

- elections
- public opinion
- reputation of a company
- trust between communities
- stock prices
    
Instead of hacking computers, they **hack the human mind**.


# 🌫️ How Influence Campaigns Lead to Misinformation and Disinformation

To influence people, attackers use two big weapons:

## ❌ 1. **Misinformation**

= **False information that spreads by accident.**  
Nobody intended harm, but the info is wrong.

**Example:**  
Your friend says, “The school holiday is tomorrow,”  
because he _heard it from someone_, but it’s false.

He didn’t want to harm anyone — just wrong info spreading like gossip.


## ❌ 2. **Disinformation**

= **False information created DELIBERATELY to deceive.**

This is dangerous and intentional.

**Example:**  
Someone purposely spreads a fake message:  
“The principal is suspended.”  
Only to create chaos.

This is **planned lying**.


# 🎯 Difference in One Line (Exam Perfect)**

- **Misinformation = wrong info shared by mistake**
- **Disinformation = wrong info shared on purpose**
    
Attackers use BOTH in influence campaigns.
