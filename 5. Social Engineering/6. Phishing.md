# 🎣 **1. What is Phishing? (The Big Net)**

Phishing is like throwing a **big fishing net** into the ocean hoping _any_ fish gets caught.

A hacker sends the **same message** to thousands of people:
- “Your bank account is locked — click here!”
- “You won a prize — claim now!”
    
They don’t care who bites.  
They just want **someone** to fall for it.

This is **broad, general, mass deception**.


# 📞 **2. Vishing (Voice Phishing)**

Vishing = **Phishing through Voice (phone calls).**
Imagine a fisherman shouting to fish:

“Hey! Come jump into my boat!”

Hackers call you pretending to be:
- Bank officers
- Police
- IT support
- Delivery services
    
Examples:  
“Your card is blocked, tell me your OTP.”  
“Your electricity bill is overdue, pay now.”

They _scare you_ or _rush you_ into giving information.


# 📱 **3. Smishing (SMS Phishing)**

Smishing = **Phishing through SMS**.

Instead of email or phone call, the hacker sends a **text message**:
- “Your courier is stuck, verify here.”
- “ATM card blocked — update KYC.”
    
It tricks people because SMS feels more personal and trustworthy.


# 🐋 **4. Whaling (Attacking the Big Fish)**

If normal phishing is catching random fish,  
**Whaling is targeting the BIG fish — CEOs, CFOs, directors.**

Attack goal:
- Steal company money
- Access confidential data
- Approve fake transactions
    
Examples:
- "CEO password reset link"
- "Legal notice from government"
- "Urgent invoice that CFO must approve"
    
Whaling = **high-value target phishing**.


# 🎯 **5. Spear Phishing (Personalized Attack)**

Spear phishing is like the fisherman saying:

“I know exactly which fish I want — and what food it likes.”
Attackers create a **customized, highly believable** message for ONE person.

Examples:
- “Hey Pavan, here’s the TryHackMe invoice you requested.”
- “Your project report has an update — download here.”
    
They use your:
- name
- job
- interests
- coworkers
- company details
    
This makes it extremely convincing.


# 💼 **6. Business Email Compromise (BEC)**

This is the **king of money-stealing scams**.
BEC happens when attackers:

✔ steal an executive’s email  
— OR —  
✔ fake an executive’s email

Then they send messages like:
- “Transfer $20,000 to this vendor immediately.”
- “Approve this urgent payment.”
- “Update our bank details.”
    
Because it appears to come from a CEO/CFO, employees obey.
This attack has caused BILLIONS in losses globally.
