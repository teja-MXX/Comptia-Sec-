# 🟦 **Diversion Theft**

A delivery truck is supposed to go to your house.

**Meaning:**  
Tricking someone into sending goods/data to the wrong person.


# 🟨 **Hoaxes**

A hoax is a **fake warning** that scares people.

Like someone shouting in school:

> “There’s a snake in the classroom!”  
> But there is no snake.

**Meaning:**  
False alerts, fake messages, fake threats that cause panic or waste time.
